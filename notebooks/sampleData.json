jinping? is he going to be able to survive this crisis? because many people were asking about his legitimacy at this point. what has he been doing? and i would say that was maybe the lowest moment.", "", "after that, in february 2020, we started to see that the situation in wuhan started to get a little bit better. the cases were going down. hospitalizations were going down. testing capacity was building up. and at that moment, we start to see xi jinping tried to rewrite himself into the narrative to show that he had actually been in control of this crisis from the beginning, that he had been issuing instructions from the beginning on how to handle this, that he had been in charge and that he hadn\u2019t been sitting back. i mean, at this point, people hadn\u2019t seen him in weeks.", "",

time when the coronavirus is getting really bad in the rest of the world. and we saw other governments around the world start to institute lockdowns, really struggle to contain their own outbreaks.

did contact tracing. they also instituted very stringent border controls. so almost no people could come into the country. and if they did, they were subject to very onerous restrictions.", "", "and over time, we saw the system gradually become more sophisticated. so for example, they added these qr codes. so when you would walk into a bar or to a restaurant or a grocery store or go onto the subway, you would have to scan these codes, which would then send your information to a government agency so that, if they found a positive case, they would be able to do a contact tracing process and basically figure out who you had been exposed to and at what time.", "", "sabrina tavernise", "wow, that\u2019s incredible.", "", "amy qin", "yeah. and later on, they added this green health code,

you\u2019d want to have green. but there have been reports, when someone goes to a city that\u2019s considered medium risk or maybe has had a recent outbreak, your code might turn yellow. more recently, we\u2019ve seen that if you go to a pharmacy and you buy medicine for a symptom that\u2019s considered to be a covid symptom, like coughing or fever, that your code then might also turn yellow. and so if your code changed to yellow or red, then you\u2019d have to self-isolate for at least a week and get tested.", "", "sabrina tavernise", "hm.", "", "amy qin", "over time, what we\u2019ve seen is that it\u2019s become even more sophisticated, to the point that they\u2019ve in some places, for example, expanded the definition of what a close contact is, so that even if your

really tried to hold up its success in controlling the coronavirus as validation for its model of governance. and they\u2019ve really harped on that in their messaging to the citizens, saying look at

weeks. they stopped traffic on the streets. they couldn\u2019t travel in and out of the city. it was pretty chaotic. and into january, we saw these lockdowns continue. at one point, there were more

simple, safe and green olympics.", "", "sabrina tavernise", "so in other words, a guy who\u2019s really used to controlling things, he staked his government\u2019s reputation on it. and suddenly,

encouraged him to do it because she had actually worked in the 2008 beijing olympics, and she wanted him to have that experience, too. but because of that, he won\u2019t be able to go home until

mean for xi, and what would it mean for china?", "", "amy qin", "well, i think in the short term, it\u2019ll be a victory for him. there have been a lot of doubters, a lot of people questioning whether he can pull this off, and whether all these measures will work. but i think in the longer term, it\u2019s more of an open question. you know, china has really betted that the virus is going to go away, and we are realizing that it\u2019s just not. there\u2019s going to be more variants. it\u2019s going to get more transmissible.", "", "and so it\u2019s not really clear that a zero-covid policy is going to be sustainable in the future. you\u2019re going to need to have more effective vaccines, and you\u2019re going to have to think about how you move this population of 1.4 billion

situation in wuhan started to get a little bit better. the cases were going down. hospitalizations were going down. testing capacity was building up. and at that moment, we start to see xi jinping

mass trauma event,\u201d bonanno chafes at this term. a traumatic event is defined as one that is unexpected and violent or life-threatening. \u201cwhen people start talking about collective trauma, they get into the illusion of some sort of medical diagnostic thing, and that's just wrong.\u201d the abundant overuse of the word \u201ctrauma\u201d in casual references means the word is losing some of its clinical weight, not least in the case of the pandemic, he thinks.\u00a0", "", "but for some, it has certainly been traumatic. health care workers, who have borne the brunt of caring for patients and seeing them suffer and die, and have worked unrelentingly long hours in difficult conditions for the past two years, are reporting record levels of post-traumatic stress disorder, a mental health condition triggered by a traumatic experience, with symptoms including flashbacks, difficulty sleeping, anxiety, and nightmares. according to modeling from the royal college of psychiatrists in the united kingdom, 40 percent of intensive care staff have symptoms of ptsd, as well as 35 percent of covid patients who have been ventilated.\u00a0", "", "to gauge the coming mental fallout from the pandemic, other epidemics may serve as models. one study conducted in hong kong looked at chronic ptsd rates among survivors of sars, two and a half years after the 2003 epidemic. almost half had ptsd at some point after the outbreak, and over a quarter were still suffering with it after 30 months. another study found that ptsd was the most common long-term psychiatric condition among survivors.", "", "", "while it might not be traumatic for all, the covid pandemic has been what is called a chronic stressor, meaning a nearly constant source of stress and anxiety. on-and-off lockdowns, millions of deaths, fragmented childhoods, devastating losses, health anxieties\u2014all have taken their toll. it\u2019s normal\u2014and reasonable\u2014that a return to normal will spark anxiety for some, says bonanno. many have grown accustomed to a hermit lifestyle, or have even found comfort in it. some may even want to stay locked inside for longer, for fear of being infected, a reaction that has been dubbed \u201ccave syndrome.\u201d and there is evidence that the constant hum of distress has translated into longer-lasting conditions for many. according to data from the uk's office for national statistics, rates of depression doubled in the uk in early 2021. reports of anxiety and depression symptoms also rose dramatically in the us.\u00a0", "", "after all, it\u2019s hard to ignore that covid is still very much here. life is inherently risky. common activities\u2014such as crossing the street or driving a car\u2014all carry risk. but the stakes are

the wave will wash through most of the world by the end of march.", "", "that poses the question: what comes next? sars-cov-2 has already provided a near-term answer. a subvariant of omicron called ba.2 is rapidly supplanting the first version, known as ba.1. in an assessment published last friday, the united kingdom\u2019s health security agency said the incidence of ba.2 there doubled in seven days. a few days before that, the statens serum institut, an arm of denmark\u2019s health ministry, said ba.2 already accounts for almost half of that nation\u2019s omicron cases.", "", "similarly quick turnovers have been reported in most of the countries maintaining good data, according to a rapid review published on twitter by the pandemic prevention institute, a project of the rockefeller foundation. its staff found the same pattern of replacement in india, germany, and japan and other asian nations, as well as the uk. as of january 30, according to the data dashboard outbreak.info, ba.2 had been found in 57 countries and 29 us states.", "", "from early findings, the ba.2 subvariant looks more transmissible than its already very infectious predecessor. there is not yet any clear signal that it causes more severe disease than ba.1 or improves on that variant\u2019s ability to escape the immune protection created by vaccines. even without enhancements, though, it's possible that ba.2 could do some damage. the original version of omicron, in circulation since november, caused less serious illness than its predecessor delta yet crushed health care systems in the us because its intense infectiousness produced so many cases in unvaccinated people.", "", "in the us, 64 percent of the population is fully vaccinated and 26 percent have gotten boosters, which bolster immunity enough to improve defenses against the original omicron. in the uk, the rates are 71 percent, with 55 percent boosted. but globally, only 52 percent of the world\u2019s population is fully vaccinated, and in some countries, mostly in sub-saharan africa, rates of full vaccination are still in the single digits. so the longer-term answer to \u201cwhat comes next?\u201d is likely to be \u201cmore surprises,\u201d as the coronavirus\u2019s restless evolution presses against the incomplete protections we have distributed patchily around the world.", "", "ba.2 isn\u2019t new, precisely. the south african researchers who flagged the emergence of the original omicron identified ba.2 a week later based on differences in the mutations that made omicron so distinct from delta. (a nomenclature note: scientists are generally calling ba.2 a \u201csublineage\u201d or \u201csubvariant\u201d because the world health organization has not classified ba.2 as a stand-alone variant earning its own greek letter. in that early work, the south african group also identified a ba.3.)", "", "but while the original omicron roared around the world right away, the second version took a while to rev up. that\u2019s puzzling to scientists, who are waiting for more data. \u201cfrom a virology perspective, it's fascinating,\u201d says nathan grubaugh, a viral epidemiologist and associate professor at the yale school of public health. \u201cthe differences in mutations between ba.1 and ba.2 are similar to the number of differences between alpha and delta. there\u2019s a lot of distance between them. so virologists and evolutionary biologists are asking: where did this come from? how is it so divergent?\u201d", "", "among the original omicron\u2019s key differences from delta, the variant that emerged in the summer of 2021, are a new ability to infect cells lining the upper airway\u2014the nose and throat, instead of the lungs\u2014along with some enhanced facility for escaping the antibody defenses created by vaccination or prior infection. in combination, those made omicron much more transmissible. as omicron ba.2 takes over, suggesting it\u2019s more transmissible still, the question becomes whether its divergence has allowed it to get better at cell entry and replication or at immune escape.", "", "the answer could determine what the next phase of the pandemic looks like. \u201cif ba.2 is able to escape immune responses better than ba.1\u2014or if it's able to escape the immune responses that so many people globally just had to ba.1\u2014then we're likely to see a resurgence in cases,\u201d grubaugh says. \u201cif ba.1 infection can protect against ba.2, then we\u2019re likely to see just a slower decline.\u201d", "", "get

onto others\u2014gave it a transmission advantage over delta. it also may have reduced the occurrence of devastating illness that marked the earliest waves of the pandemic by keeping the virus from invading the lungs and other organs. data published last week by the us centers for disease control and prevention shows that, even though case numbers and hospitalizations soared during the omicron wave, health care metrics that indicate severe illness\u2014such as the number of days patients stayed in hospitals and whether they were admitted to an icu\u2014actually decreased.", "", "but whether covid is now intrinsically a more mild disease or has been rendered that way by the blunting effect of immunity from vaccination or infection can\u2019t yet be determined. the emergence of omicron ba.1 and ba.2 were detected by genomic studies, but it\u2019s too soon to have results from the kind of lab assays and population studies that will help untangle whether sars-cov-2 is becoming less virulent as it settles into endemicity. many virologists are skeptical. \u201ci can\u2019t think of a virus in history that has evolved to mildness,\u201d says rick bright, a virologist and former director of the us biomedical advanced research and development authority. \u201cevolution favors transmissibility.\u201d", "", "bright, who now leads the rockefeller prevention initiative, argues the us has been missing opportunities to build tools that could detect the emergence of variants more quickly. before omicron arrived, the cdc switched away from studying most breakthrough infections, choosing to analyze only ones that sent people to the hospital or killed them. the rockefeller team thinks the mild infections that the agency no longer prioritizes could hold crucial information. \u201cthat is the primordial soup, where the virus is evolving and mutating,\u201d bright says.", "", "\u201cwe have to invest in sequencing the mild cases, and when we do that, we're going to light up that battlefield where this virus is changing and evolving,\u201d he adds. \u201cwe can wait for these dangerous variants to smack us in the face, or we can look at the evolution under the surface of this virus and predict where the virus will go.\u201d", "", "some of the first indications that omicron and then ba.2 emerged in the us came from wastewater sampling, which is an inexpensive and relatively low-tech surveillance scheme compared to testing patients and reporting their results to information systems governed by state authorities and federal privacy laws. the shock of the newest variants\u2019 arrival could be enough to drive adoption of additional data sources to flag them: passively collected mobility info, at-home rapid-test results, immunity surveys over zip codes or census tracts.", "", "all the red flags in the world, though, won\u2019t stop new variants from arriving. sars-cov-2 can\u2019t be chased from the planet\u2014it has found a home in multiple animal species\u2014but we can deny it the chance to adapt to human immune systems. protection could be conferred by prior infection, though this is not guaranteed: omicron caused reinfections in people who had already contracted delta and breakthrough infections in people who had taken the vaccines. and developing immunity through infection alone risks an unpredictable illness and recovery, or long covid, or the whole-body inflammatory attack in children known as mis-c.", "", "the simpler answer is to distribute full courses of vaccines, including boosters, as widely as possible. \u201cthe best way to prevent more, more-dangerous, or more-transmissible variants from emerging is to stop unconstrained spread, and that requires many integrated public-health interventions, including, crucially, vaccine equity,\u201d aris katzourakis, a professor of evolution and genomics at the university of oxford, wrote in nature last week.", "", "vaccine equity has consistently been where the world\u2019s pandemic response stumbles and stops. researchers say\u2014and have said so often that they now sound despairing\u2014that pandemic control can never succeed until vaccine access improves. worldwide, more than 3 billion people have received no vaccine at all.", "", "\u201cthere is no reason at all why the next variant\u2014which will happen, because of the billions of people in whom billions of virus particles are replicating right now\u2014by sheer chance, could be way more sinister than omicron,\u201d says madhukar pai, the canada research chair in epidemiology and global health at mcgill university. \u201cthere is no reason at all, from everything we've seen with this virus, to hope that the next variant will not emerge, or that omicron will be a mass immunizing event that will see us to the end of the pandemic.\u201d", "", "the interplay between vaccines and new variants is visible in a preprint that grubaugh posted online last week, containing the results of a study by yale and university of nebraska researchers of 37,877 pcr-positive covid tests performed as omicron was moving into connecticut. the research, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, shows that two vaccine doses created some defense against delta, forcing the positive test rate down by almost half compared to people who were unvaccinated. adding boosters reduced the positive rate by 83 percent. but among the people who became infected with omicron, significant protection didn\u2019t kick in until after they received boosters\u2014and even then, half of the participants still registered positive on their covid tests.", "", "the funny thing about that finding was that grubaugh predicted it\u2014last month, in a paper in the journal cell written with sarah cobey, an associate professor at the university of chicago. the authors envisioned that the next successful variant would leapfrog over its predecessors by combining increased transmissibility, the advantage delta possessed, with greater facility for immune escape, the trick deployed by earlier variants. the catch: they thought a newer, more nimble variant would emerge from delta\u2014and not, as omicron did, from a distant branch of the virus\u2019s evolutionary tree.", "", "grubaugh acknowledges that this constitutes a lesson about the need to think through all the possibilities. \u201cwe lacked the imagination to see that there's some unknown reservoir floating around, in which this virus evolved in such a divergent way,\u201d he says. it\u2019s a useful reminder that as omicron 1 and 2 and 3 gnaw at the outer edges of how transmissible a virus can become, sars-cov-2 can still retain the capacity to surprise.", "", "more from wired on covid-19", "\ud83d\udce9 the latest on tech, science, and more: get our newsletters!",

covid\u2019s evolution by moving toward a strategy of living with the virus, china continues to rely on some of its harshest restrictions since the outbreak began. surrounding the lunar new year and winter olympics, small but regular outbreaks of the omicron and delta variants have left chinese authorities scrambling. after beijing failed to trace its first local omicron infection in january, its

government insisting on pursuing a zero-tolerance strategy? the official line is that abandoning it would lead to a devastating outbreak that would overwhelm the health care system and disrupt social stability. and experts say this is valid\u2014to a certain degree. but the situation is far from straightforward.", "", "one key challenge is that chinese vaccines are proving to be less effective. while approximately 87 percent of china\u2019s total population is vaccinated, the majority received doses of the country\u2019s homegrown sinovac and sinopharm inactivated-virus vaccines, which use a dead version of the virus to expose the body\u2019s immune system to it. about one-third of the population has also received inactivated-virus booster shots.", "", "in december, researchers from hong kong found that two doses of sinovac failed to produce enough antibodies to fight omicron. pfizer and moderna\u2019s vaccines, while less effective against omicron than previous strains, still provide substantial protection\u2014especially after three doses. and even before the variants arrived, china\u2019s vaccines were still some way behind the west\u2019s mrna jabs. the numbers are stark: sinovac is 51 percent effective in preventing symptomatic covid infection. pfizer is 95 percent effective. china has yet to approve pfizer and moderna\u2019s shots for use on the mainland, although shanghai-based fosun pharmaceuticals was given the right to distribute pfizer\u2019s vaccine to hong kong, macau, and taiwan.", "", "advertisement", "", "that issue of vaccine effectiveness is compounded by the uneven spread of coverage throughout china. much of the country\u2019s elderly population also remains unvaccinated and vulnerable\u2014due to the government's decision to delay vaccinating seniors in order to prioritize those in high-risk jobs and to ensure the vaccine was safe for older people. (chinese vaccine makers reportedly included fewer elderly people in final-stage trials than did those in the west.) although china opened up vaccinations for seniors aged 60 and above in march, health

chinese vaccines are not that effective in preventing infections. they cannot tolerate even a small number of infections.\u201d", "", "what has for so long been a point of national pride is now something of a trap. with ineffective vaccines and low protection from previous infections, a large-scale covid outbreak could threaten vulnerable communities and overwhelm china\u2019s health care system. to address this threat, china is adapting. responding to the delta variant in august, the government moved from its initial \u201czero-covid\u201d policy of literally pursuing zero cases to its current \u201cdynamic zero-covid\u201d strategy, which seeks to instead swiftly crack down on outbreaks when they inevitably occur.", "", "that shift in strategy doesn\u2019t necessarily mean a loosening of restrictions. in the short run, the state will continue enforcing strict measures, like snap lockdowns, because unlike many countries\u2014where lockdowns have become politically and economically unfeasible\u2014china is both able to do so and prepared to pay the cost, according to ben cowling, chair of epidemiology at the university of hong kong. and in purely economic terms, the policy isn\u2019t too much of a drag on china. a recent report by the australia and new zealand banking group found that the dynamic zero-covid approach had shaved just 2.6 percent off the chinese economy in terms of gross domestic product. \u201cchina\u2019s been really good at cracking down and getting to zero,\u201d says cowling. \u201cit\u2019s very disruptive and involves lockdowns, mass testing, and isolation of cases, but that\u2019s affecting a minority of people. if they can limit the spread, i\u2019d say it\u2019s an optimal strategy.\u201d", "", "as with the rest of the world, china is seeking to buy time so it can use science to beat back the virus\u2014but on its own terms. in the coming months, officials are pinning their hopes on developing better, homegrown mrna vaccines to target omicron and other variants. the current mrna frontrunner, arcov, completed its first-stage clinical trials (on 120 people between the ages of 18 and 59) and was found to have an efficacy rate of 80 to 95 percent, which is on par with pfizer and moderna\u2019s vaccines.", "", "and arcov might even have a logistical advantage. unlike pfizer and moderna, which are challenging to distribute and store, this mrna vaccine can be kept for six months at a normal refrigerator temperature of between 2 and 8 degrees celsius. pfizer and moderna, by comparison, have to be kept at minus 70 degrees celsius and minus 20 degrees celsius, respectively. experts predict that at least one chinese mrna vaccine could be launched for public use by the end of the year and an omicron-targeting vaccine may be ready in two to six months\u2019 time.", "", "yet scientists like dongyan jin, a biomedical professor at the university of hong kong, argue that it is \u201ccompletely unwise\u201d to wait for the development of homegrown vaccines instead of simply approving pfizer or moderna. not only will waiting stall the process of building higher immunity in the population, but there\u2019s also no guarantee that homegrown vaccines will be effective. currently being tested in a global phase 3 clinical trial, arcov recently exhibited a sharp drop in neutralizing antibodies against omicron\u2014although a third booster shot did trigger antibody activity in animal tests.", "", "\u201cthere is no scientific reason for not approving them,\u201d says jin of the pfizer and moderna vaccines, adding that the chinese government has made similar mistakes in the past. jin cites the delayed approval of the human papillomavirus (hpv) vaccines against cervical cancer, which is the third most common cancer among women in china aged 15 to 44 and the sixth most frequent among women overall, as one such example. although the first hpv vaccine was licensed by the us in 2006 and then by 80 more countries a year later, foreign hpv vaccines were only approved in china from 2016 to 2018, due to regulatory delays (china\u2019s food and drug administration required repeated clinical trials to ensure safety and effectiveness prior to approval). china still suffers from a supply shortage of hpv vaccines, even after the country launched its first locally produced hpv vaccine in 2020.", "", "in the fight against covid, delays could prove even more costly. even if homegrown vaccines are successfully developed, china would still need to make and administer them\u2014though it only took 10 months to jab 1 billion people against covid back in 2021. that\u2019s quick, but huang argues it\u2019s unlikely to be quick enough. \u201cby the time china achieves a high vaccination rate, the omicron-driven wave might already be in retreat,\u201d he says. \u201cwe are likely going to see the emergence and dominance of new variants.\u201d", "", "so why doesn\u2019t china approve western vaccines? as well as citing the need to protect the domestic market, calvin ho, a bioethicist at the university of hong kong, says the move would also be costly and could trigger a global supply crisis. \u201ceven if they approved pfizer, it\u2019s going to take some time to vaccinate everyone. leaving aside the financial cost, there would be implications of global justice. if china approves it and is prepared to pay, what would be the implications for other countries that cannot afford it?\u201d ho says. \u201crealistically speaking, the way forward may be to hope there will be a more effective vaccine developed in the mainland or hong kong.\u201d", "", "china\u2019s stance may be shifting. in a surprise move, the country this week conditionally approved pfizer\u2019s paxlovid pill\u2014even though the country is developing its own antiviral drugs and treatments. earlier this month, an antiviral drug called favilavir reportedly received approval to move forward with clinical trials investigating its possible use as a treatment against covid, and the state\u2019s drug authority granted emergency approval for a monoclonal antibody treatment in december. but the latter needs to be administered through injections, which huang says would still put a burden on the health care system, since patients would need to go to the hospital.", "", "and even if china can develop its own vaccines and treatments, that doesn\u2019t mean it will abandon its dynamic covid-zero strategy, officials have said. \u201cas long as china has no new measures to prevent the imported strains of the coronavirus from triggering large-scale transmission and no effective way to contain the epidemic, the country will not adjust its dynamic zero-tolerance policy,\u201d wu zunyou, chief epidemiologist of the chinese center for disease control and prevention, told state media outfit global times in early february. \u201crelying on vaccines cannot contain

over-the-counter antihistamines. importantly, the findings are only anecdotal at this point, but they may point to new avenues of research for understanding and treating this complex condition.", "the report, published monday in the journal for nurse practitioners, concerns two middle-aged women believed to have caught covid-19 during the first year of the pandemic. both were generally healthy and regularly exercised prior to their illness, and both developed a variety of lingering symptoms following their initial bout of sickness. these chronic symptoms included fatigue, cognitive impairment (often known as brain fog), and an inability to tolerate exercise, while one patient even appeared to develop \u201ccovid toes\u201d\u2014the discoloration and pain along a person\u2019s toes and

and sometimes used antihistamines to treat them, though.", "in one case, six months after her initial symptoms began, the woman (who had a history of allergies triggered by dairy) ate a piece of cheese, which led her to take an over-the-counter antihistamine medication. soon after, she experienced \u201cconsiderable relief of fatigue and improved ability to concentrate,\u201d which then returned over the next three days when she stopped taking the medication. in the second case, the woman switched to a different antihistamine medication than usual 13 months into her long covid, after which she experienced the same pattern of almost immediate relief. both women have since continued to routinely take antihistamines, and both have reported a near-full recovery of their symptoms, even allowing them to exercise regularly again.", "there have been reports among long covid patient groups on social media about the possible benefits of antihistamines. these cases were even brought to the attention of these researchers, primarily from the university of california, irvine, through members of survivor corps, a long covid advocacy group hosted on facebook. but near as they can tell, these are the first case reports in the literature to document the potential of antihistamines for patients with long covid, also known as postacute sequelae of sars-cov-2, or pasc.", "\u201cthe clinical presentations described here are consistent with other research on pasc and offer anecdotal evidence for treatment of pasc symptoms with a highly accessible over-the-counter histamine antagonist,\u201d the authors wrote.", "as the authors note, there is clear evidence that a dysfunctional immune system can contribute to covid symptoms, including aspects of our immunity that could be regulated through antihistamines. so there may be a plausible mechanism for their success here. but there are some very important considerations to be noted as well.", "for one, neither woman tested positive for an active case of covid-19, though they did experience common acute symptoms such as fever, cough, and body aches (in one case, the woman\u2019s illness reportedly began in january 2020, when pcr testing was severely limited). nor did either patient test positive for antibodies for the coronavirus at a later date. these negative results do not mean that they didn\u2019t contract covid-19. neither pcr nor antibody tests are 100% accurate and people\u2019s antibody levels can wane over time, while some never develop a robust antibody response to infection. but it could hold some importance for comparing the potential of these treatments for those with antibodies and those without.", "another factor is that long covid is suspected to have more than one root cause. so even if antihistamines can benefit some patients, they may not do much of anything for others. in any case, the authors say that more research is needed to test out the promise of these drugs for long covid. and\u00a0they also advise that if patients want to explore these treatments right now, they should ideally work together with their medical providers to do so.", "\u201cmost patients tell us that providers have not recommended anything that has helped. if patients wish to try otc antihistamines, i urge them to do so under medical supervision. and because providers may not know about new potential treatments, i would encourage patients to be active in their care and consider taking research and case reports like ours to appointments with providers so they can help create a regimen that will work,\u201d said study author melissa pinto, an associate professor of nursing at uci, in a statement. \u201cthe next steps for this research into antihistamine treatment are to conduct

from all over the world to beijing.", "ok, so tell me how china got to this point where it\u2019s pursuing a strategy of zero covid, one that really seems pretty unthinkable in most parts of the world.", "so china\u2019s zero-covid strategy is actually rooted in how this virus came about. it first emerged two years ago, around december 2019, in wuhan. and back then, it was this mysterious virus. people didn\u2019t really know that much about it, and it was circulating. and a lot of doctors in wuhan hospitals started to notice that there were these patients trickling in, and they were very worried about it.", "they tried to sound the alarm, but local officials were really concerned, and they didn\u2019t really want it to disrupt the politics and the social stability. and it kind of spiraled out of control, to the point where the central government had to step in. and in january 2020, they locked down the entire city of wuhan.", "[shouting] residents of wuhan locked inside their high-rise apartments, screaming for help.", "and it was just a very bleak period. and i remember people were so angry, people were so upset that the government wasn\u2019t responding in the way that they felt they should be.", "there was bad communication, and the top leader, xi jinping, he was nowhere to be seen. and for the government, it was a huge moment of crisis. and it really escalated in february 2020, when this doctor who had tried to sound the alarm earlier about the coronavirus \u2014", "the chinese whistleblower doctor who told the world about the coronavirus in wuhan has died.", "and people were so upset. i remember on that night just looking at my social media feed, and everyone was talking about it. and that was a moment when many of us analysts and people in the country were wondering, what does this mean for xi jinping? is he going to be able to survive this crisis? because many people were asking about his legitimacy at this point. what has he been doing? and i would say that was maybe the lowest moment.", "after that, in february 2020, we started to see that the situation in wuhan started to get a little bit better. the cases were going down. hospitalizations were going down. testing capacity was building up. and at that moment, we start to see xi jinping tried to rewrite himself into the narrative to show that he had actually been in control of this crisis from the beginning, that he had been issuing instructions from the beginning on how to handle this, that he had been in charge and that he hadn\u2019t been sitting back. i mean, at this point, people hadn\u2019t seen him in weeks.", "and in early march 2020, he finally goes down to wuhan, and he visits with the frontline workers, he talks to the officials there. and i think in that moment, for him it was almost a way to claim victory, to show that we can turn this crisis around. and soon after that, wuhan actually reached zero cases for the first time since the virus first started emerging in late 2019. and that was just such a huge moment of relief and celebration, too. i mean, people were so excited to finally be able to go out into the streets again and return to normal life.", "and this is all happening at a time when the coronavirus is getting really bad in the rest of the world. and we saw other governments around the world start to institute lockdowns, really struggle to contain their own outbreaks. and there was a split-screen contrast between this relatively normal life at home within china and what was happening with the rest of the world. and it played really well among chinese citizens. and i think the government saw this, and they decided that we need to from now on maintain the zero-covid strategy, and we really need to show off the legitimacy of our top-down centralized system.", "so what we saw after that was the chinese government really put into place this wildly ambitious program that was basically drawing on their lessons from wuhan, and applied that all across the country. so what they did was they had a lot of snap lockdowns, mass testing. they did contact tracing. they also instituted very stringent border controls. so almost no people could come into the country. and if they did, they were subject to very onerous restrictions.", "and over time, we saw the system gradually become more sophisticated. so for example, they added these qr codes. so when you would walk into a bar or to a restaurant or a grocery store or go onto the subway, you would have to scan these codes, which would then send your information to a government agency so that, if they found a positive case, they would be able to do a contact tracing process and basically figure out who you had been exposed to and at what time.", "yeah. and later on, they added this green health code, which is basically like a digital passport that you have on your phone. and you need to have this in order to go basically into any public space \u2014 into buildings, into offices, into restaurants. and it\u2019s color coded, so it shows either green, yellow or red. and it uses location data and other kinds of data to basically determine your risk for covid.", "and ideally, of course, you\u2019d want to have green. but there have been reports, when someone goes to a city that\u2019s considered medium risk or maybe has had a recent outbreak, your code might turn yellow. more recently, we\u2019ve seen that if you go to a pharmacy and you buy medicine for a symptom that\u2019s considered to be a covid symptom, like coughing or fever, that your code then might also turn yellow. and so if your code changed to yellow or red, then you\u2019d have to self-isolate for at least a week and get tested.", "over time, what we\u2019ve seen is that it\u2019s become even more sophisticated, to the point that they\u2019ve in some places, for example, expanded the definition of what a close contact is, so that even if your cell phone signal is within half a mile of someone who is thought to have been exposed to covid, then you\u2019re considered a close contact, even if you didn\u2019t pass by this person.", "yeah. and there was also a low-tech element to this, as well. basically starting in wuhan, the government really turned to what\u2019s called the grid workers. they\u2019re basically community workers. oftentimes, they\u2019re volunteers, or sometimes even just communist party members, sort of community busybodies who maybe before the pandemic spent their time pulling weeds and making sure that the neighborhood was safe. but during the pandemic, they really took on this new role, where they were the enforcers of the government\u2019s policies.", "and a lot of them would be stationed at these residential complexes, making sure that they recorded the identities of everyone who came in and out, that they took temperatures of everyone who came in and out. they went door to door and made sure that people who are vaccinated. and they were really filling in the gaps for what the high-tech solutions couldn\u2019t do. and i think this combination of this high tech plus just sheer manpower really made the government\u2019s zero-covid policy a huge success.", "well, for a long time, there were many days in which they reported zero locally transmitted cases. and maybe sometimes they would find a few, but for the most part, there really was not really that much virus. people in china were able to live largely normal lives. i mean, they had to wear masks, they still had to measure their temperatures when they went into places. but for the most part, there really was very little virus in the country, as far as we know.", "if you look at the graph of covid deaths and cases in china, you see a big spike in january to april 2020, but then after that, it basically just flatlines. i mean, if you even look at the death toll today, china has only had 4,600 or so deaths from the coronavirus.", "i think so. i mean, obviously there was a lot made in the beginning about was china accurately reporting the number of cases and deaths in wuhan, but after wuhan, the incentives really changed. officials were really incentivized to actually find the cases, and not to cover them up. because if the outbreaks happened on their watch, that\u2019s when they got into trouble.", "and i think that maybe there were some cases that were missed, but i think if there were a lot more deaths, we would know that. we would know that from the hospital being overwhelmed. we would hear that. and we just haven\u2019t heard that.", "well, china\u2019s actually developed its own vaccines. and there\u2019s been some questions about the efficacy, but they\u2019ve been really successful with the uptake. they\u2019ve gotten actually over 85% of their population vaccinated now.", "so it sounds like xi\u2019s zero covid gamble really did pay off, and it paid off reputationally, too. like, it looked like he was in charge, and he was pretty good at handling this big, complicated public health challenge.", "definitely. i think that the chinese government has really tried to hold up its success in controlling the coronavirus as validation for its model of governance. and they\u2019ve really harped on that in their messaging to the citizens, saying look at the chaos of the west, and then look at us at home. we have a relatively normal life. our economy is still going. we haven\u2019t had these crazy lockdowns. this is china\u2019s success. this is the success of our system.", "right. and the chinese people were hugely supportive of this policy. it had enabled them to live this relatively normal life. and that went on for about a year and a half, until the fall of 2021. and that\u2019s when the variants hit. and that posed a new challenge for xi jinping.", "ok, tell me what happened after the covid variants started showing up in china.", "so we started to see these small outbreaks appearing around the country. they were oftentimes coming in via travelers who were traveling to china, and they were infecting airport workers because the virus was more transmissible, so it was just harder to stop. but china basically just continued to throw its zero-covid playbook at it. they instituted snap lockdowns. if they found a few cases in a city, they might lockdown the entire city and institute mass testing.", "so it\u2019s really disruptive. it\u2019s really disrupting people\u2019s lives.", "we\u2019ve heard these crazy stories. there was one woman who was on a second date with a man. she was at his family\u2019s home, and they instituted a snap lockdown in the town where she was because a case had been found, and she ended up having to quarantine with this man and his family for a month.", "oh my god. she didn\u2019t know them, and she was quarantining with them for a month?", "luckily, she seemed to get along very well with them. my colleague spoke to her, and she said that they\u2019re planning to get engaged soon. so \u2014", "\u2014 yeah, but in other cases, it\u2019s been kind of a nightmare. i spoke with another woman who was in shanghai, and she had just been to an office building \u2014 not her own office building \u2014 for a meeting. and she\u2019d been there for an hour.", "and the next day, she was getting ready for bed, and she got an email basically saying you need to come back to this office right away. she went back, and it turns out that someone who had been exposed to the virus had been on that floor the day before she was there, and so there was a possibility that she might have the virus. and so she ended up having to quarantine in this office with 200 other people for two days while they got tested.", "they were sleeping in sleeping bags. she sent me a photo of her sleeping bag on a windowsill. there were no showers.", "she told me about one man that she met there who actually had been there for a job interview, and then he had been called back and he ended up having to isolate with all the people that he had interviewed with.", "so it\u2019s just created a lot of uncertainty, and you\u2019re definitely starting to hear more grumbling from people about these policies. we saw in december there was an entire city of 13 million people was shut down over a delta outbreak. they were confined to their apartments for weeks. they stopped traffic on the streets. they couldn\u2019t travel in and out of the city. it was pretty chaotic. and into january, we saw these lockdowns continue. at one point, there were more than 20 million people in china under lockdown in various cities.", "in one city, they had found three asymptomatic cases, and they locked down an entire city of 1.2 million people.", "ok, so it sounds like the variants put some real strain on china\u2019s policy of no covid.", "it has. and it\u2019s all been happening in the weeks leading up to the winter olympics, which, for xi jinping, was supposed to be this moment \u2014", "\u2014 and to show the strength of the chinese system, especially in this period of the pandemic, when the chinese system has done so well in keeping the virus out, for the most part, and keeping covid deaths down.", "but what we\u2019ve seen is, in the weeks leading up to the olympics, xi jinping has been shifting the messaging a little bit. he\u2019s sort of backing away from this grandiose framing of the olympics as this opportunity to showcase the chinese nation, and we\u2019ve seen him talk about the olympics and just say we just want to have a simple, safe and green olympics.", "so in other words, a guy who\u2019s really used to controlling things, he staked his government\u2019s reputation on it. and suddenly, right when he had planned to show the world how well china had handled the virus, he can\u2019t actually control the virus.", "right. and i think that\u2019s why we\u2019re starting to see this shift away from this focus on zero cases, and more towards this idea that the government can actually just respond quickly and nimbly to small outbreaks, and get them under control very decisively. and we\u2019re seeing all of this in action now in the olympic bubble.", "so there\u2019s basically one big bubble in beijing. it\u2019s three areas. it\u2019s connected by these designated trains, buses and taxis that are only working for the olympics. they\u2019re so isolated that the beijing government has even informed the public that if there is an accident, don\u2019t go help these vehicles. we have a special team on standby to go help them. that\u2019s how much they don\u2019t want us to come into contact with them.", "i went around to the media center today, and \u2014 well, first of all, there were a lot of robots, because basically they\u2019re trying to minimize the amount that humans have to do within the bubble. and so we saw in the cafeteria, for example, there were dumpling-making robots.", "there were robots making cocktails. there were robots delivering food where \u2014 it\u2019s almost like in a claw machine, where it comes above you, and then it just sort of drops down your plate of food right at your table, and then you just take it off and then it goes back up.", "yeah, it\u2019s all pretty strange. but everyone who is coming into the bubble has to stay in the bubble. we can\u2019t leave, and i can\u2019t really speak to anyone here in china. i mean, i\u2019ve really only been able to have a few conversations. there was a really nice taxi driver this morning who was telling me about how he had entered the bubble last month, and he was so sad to spend the lunar new year holiday by himself, but his wife had encouraged him to do it because she had actually worked in the 2008 beijing olympics, and she wanted him to have that experience, too. but because of that, he won\u2019t be able to go home until march.", "wow. ok, so amy, let\u2019s say that all of these measures actually accomplish what xi jinping wants \u2014 a safe, simple olympics, like he says. what will that mean for xi, and what would it mean for china?", "well, i think in the short term, it\u2019ll be a victory for him. there have been a lot of doubters, a lot of people questioning whether he can pull this off, and whether all these measures will work. but i think in the longer term, it\u2019s more of an open question. you know, china has really betted that the virus is going to go away, and we are realizing that it\u2019s just not. there\u2019s going to be more variants. it\u2019s going to get more transmissible.", "and so it\u2019s not really clear that a zero-covid policy is going to be sustainable in the future. you\u2019re going to need to have more effective vaccines, and you\u2019re going to have to think about how you move this population of 1.4 billion people that has basically no immunity to the virus back into normal society. and eventually, xi jinping is going to have to figure out how to get people to the point where they feel comfortable living with the virus, just like everyone else is trying to figure that out right now, too.", "here\u2019s what else you need to know

wuhan. so what\u2019s it like to be back?", "honestly, it\u2019s very surreal. we landed today, and we were greeted by an army of airport workers in hazmat suits, goggles, shoe covers. and we\u2019re here in the city, but it doesn\u2019t really feel like we\u2019re in the city because we\u2019re in this huge bubble, and we aren\u2019t really able to move around. i\u2019m in this hotel room now, and we can only go between various other hotels and the competition venues. so it\u2019s really strange to be back.", "well, china has been adhering throughout the pandemic to this policy that\u2019s become known as the zero-covid policy. china\u2019s leader, xi jinping, has basically made it his goal to keep the virus out of the country as much as possible. and that\u2019s really difficult when you have thousands of people coming in from all over the world to beijing.", "ok, so tell me how china got to this point where it\u2019s pursuing a strategy of zero covid, one that really seems pretty unthinkable in most parts of the world.", "so china\u2019s zero-covid strategy is actually rooted in how this virus came about. it first emerged two years ago, around december 2019, in wuhan. and back then, it was this mysterious virus. people didn\u2019t really know that much about it, and it was circulating. and a lot of doctors in wuhan hospitals started to notice that there were these patients trickling in, and they were very worried about it.", "they tried to sound the alarm, but local officials were really concerned, and they didn\u2019t really want it to disrupt the politics and the social stability. and it kind of spiraled out of control, to the point where the central government had to step in. and in january 2020, they locked down the entire city of wuhan.", "[shouting] residents of wuhan locked inside their high-rise apartments, screaming for help.", "and it was just a very bleak period. and i remember people were so angry, people were so upset that the government wasn\u2019t responding in the way that they felt they should be.", "there was bad communication, and the top leader, xi jinping, he was nowhere to be seen. and for the government, it was a huge moment of crisis. and it really escalated in february 2020, when this doctor who had tried to sound the alarm earlier about the coronavirus \u2014", "the chinese whistleblower doctor who told the world about the coronavirus in wuhan has died.", "and people were so upset. i remember on that night just looking at my social media feed, and everyone was talking about it. and that was a moment when many of us analysts and people in the country were wondering, what does this mean for xi jinping? is he going to be able to survive this crisis? because many people were asking about his legitimacy at this point. what has he been doing? and i would say that was maybe the lowest moment.", "after that, in february 2020, we started to see that the situation in wuhan started to get a little bit better. the cases were going down. hospitalizations were going down. testing capacity was building up. and at that moment, we start to see xi jinping tried to rewrite himself into the narrative to show that he had actually been in control of this crisis from the beginning, that he had been issuing instructions from the beginning on how to handle this, that he had been in charge and that he hadn\u2019t been sitting back. i mean, at this point, people hadn\u2019t seen him in weeks.", "and in early march 2020, he finally goes down to wuhan, and he visits with the frontline workers, he talks to the officials there. and i think in that moment, for him it was almost a way to claim victory, to show that we can turn this crisis around. and soon after that, wuhan actually reached zero cases for the first time since the virus first started emerging in late 2019. and that was just such a huge moment of relief and celebration, too. i mean, people were so excited to finally be able to go out into the streets again and return to normal life.", "and this is all happening at a time when the coronavirus is getting really bad in the rest of the world. and we saw other governments around the world start to institute lockdowns, really struggle to contain their own outbreaks. and there was a split-screen contrast between this relatively normal life at home within china and what was happening with the rest of the world. and it played really well among chinese citizens. and i think the government saw this, and they decided that we need to from now on maintain the zero-covid strategy, and we really need to show off the legitimacy of our top-down centralized system.", "so what we saw after that was the chinese government really put into place this wildly ambitious program that was basically drawing on their lessons from wuhan, and applied that all across the country. so what they did was they had a lot of snap lockdowns, mass testing. they did contact tracing. they also instituted very stringent border controls. so almost no people could come into the country. and if they did, they were subject to very onerous restrictions.", "and over time, we saw the system gradually become more sophisticated. so for example, they added these qr codes. so when you would walk into a bar or to a restaurant or a grocery store or go onto the subway, you would have to scan these codes, which would then send your information to a government agency so that, if they found a positive case, they would be able to do a contact tracing process and basically figure out who you had been exposed to and at what time.", "yeah. and later on, they added this green health code, which is basically like a digital passport that you have on your phone. and you need to have this in order to go basically into any public space \u2014 into buildings, into offices, into restaurants. and it\u2019s color coded, so it shows either green, yellow or red. and it uses location data and other kinds of data to basically determine your risk for covid.", "and ideally, of course, you\u2019d want to have green. but there have been reports, when someone goes to a city that\u2019s considered medium risk or maybe has had a recent outbreak, your code might turn yellow. more recently, we\u2019ve seen that if you go to a pharmacy and you buy medicine for a symptom that\u2019s considered to be a covid symptom, like coughing or fever, that your code then might also turn yellow. and so if your code changed to yellow or red, then you\u2019d have to self-isolate for at least a week and get tested.", "over time, what we\u2019ve seen is that it\u2019s become even more sophisticated, to the point that they\u2019ve in some places, for example, expanded the definition of what a close contact is, so that even if your cell phone signal is within half a mile of someone who is thought to have been exposed to covid, then you\u2019re considered a close contact, even if you didn\u2019t pass by this person.", "yeah. and there was also a low-tech element to this, as well. basically starting in wuhan, the government really turned to what\u2019s called the grid workers. they\u2019re basically community workers. oftentimes, they\u2019re volunteers, or sometimes even just communist party members, sort of community busybodies who maybe before the pandemic spent their time pulling weeds and making sure that the neighborhood was safe. but during the pandemic, they really took on this new role, where they were the enforcers of the government\u2019s policies.", "and a lot of them would be stationed at these residential complexes, making sure that they recorded the identities of everyone who came in and out, that they took temperatures of everyone who came in and

this high tech plus just sheer manpower really made the government\u2019s zero-covid policy a huge success.", "well, for a long time, there were many days in which they reported zero locally

wuhan, but after wuhan, the incentives really changed. officials were really incentivized to actually find the cases, and not to cover them up. because if the outbreaks happened on their watch,

declare\u2014arguably prematurely\u2014that the worst of the pandemic is behind them. it\u2019s time to get on with it, to learn to live with covid, they say. the world health organization has warned that new variants are likely to emerge and that the pandemic is nowhere near over. but a wise decision or not, it\u2019s happening.\u00a0", "now what? stuck at home for the past two years, our social skills have decayed, we\u2019ve outgrown our jeans, and we've developed an unrelenting suspicion for every cough and sneeze. but now, suddenly, we\u2019ve been set free, urged to dive back into a wild west revision of the new normal. how will we cope? and what wounds will we be carrying?\u00a0", "george bonanno, a clinical psychologist at teachers college, columbia university, reckons most people will welcome the return to normal (or some semblance of the previous normality). \u201ci think people are really ready to move out from under the shadow of this thing,\u201d he says. in his book, the end of trauma, he makes the case that humans are more resilient than we give ourselves credit for. while some have dubbed the pandemic a \u201ccollective mass trauma event,\u201d bonanno chafes at this term. a traumatic event is defined as one that is unexpected and violent or life-threatening. \u201cwhen people start talking about collective trauma, they get into the illusion of some sort of medical diagnostic thing, and that's just wrong.\u201d the abundant overuse of the word \u201ctrauma\u201d in casual references means the word is losing some of its clinical weight, not least in the case of the pandemic, he thinks.\u00a0", "but for some, it has certainly been traumatic. health care workers, who have borne the brunt of caring for patients and seeing them suffer and die, and have worked unrelentingly long hours in difficult conditions for the past two years, are reporting record levels of post-traumatic stress disorder, a mental health condition triggered by a traumatic experience, with symptoms including flashbacks, difficulty sleeping, anxiety, and nightmares. according to modeling from the royal college of psychiatrists in the united kingdom, 40 percent of intensive care staff have symptoms of ptsd, as well as 35 percent of covid patients who have been ventilated.\u00a0", "to gauge the coming mental fallout from the pandemic, other epidemics may serve as models. one study conducted in hong kong looked at chronic ptsd rates among survivors of sars, two and a half years after the 2003 epidemic. almost half had ptsd at some point after the outbreak, and over a quarter were still suffering with it after 30 months. another study found that ptsd was the most common long-term psychiatric condition among survivors.", "while it might not be traumatic for all, the covid pandemic has been what is called a chronic stressor, meaning a nearly constant source of stress and anxiety. on-and-off lockdowns, millions of deaths, fragmented childhoods, devastating losses, health anxieties\u2014all have taken their toll. it\u2019s normal\u2014and reasonable\u2014that a return to normal will spark anxiety for some, says bonanno. many have grown accustomed to a hermit lifestyle, or have even found comfort in it. some may even want to stay locked inside for longer, for fear of being infected, a reaction that has been dubbed \u201ccave syndrome.\u201d and there is evidence that the constant hum of distress has translated into longer-lasting conditions for many. according to data from the uk's office for national statistics, rates of depression doubled in the uk in early 2021. reports of anxiety and depression symptoms also rose dramatically in the us.\u00a0", "after all, it\u2019s hard to ignore that covid is still very much here. life is inherently risky. common activities\u2014such as crossing the street or driving a car\u2014all carry risk. but the stakes are higher now for many everyday activities. before the pandemic, the biggest risk of a trip to the pub was the next day\u2019s hangover. now, it\u2019s catching a virus. \u201cwhat i think is hard now is that people kind of want to say, \u2018well, when

american people with those vital tests, the move was quickly lauded; millions of americans were frustrated at their inability to score these at their local drugstores. they were also miffed at the

possible that ba.2 could do some damage. the original version of omicron, in circulation since november, caused less serious illness than its predecessor delta yet crushed health care systems in the us because its intense infectiousness produced so many cases in unvaccinated people.", "in the us, 64 percent of the population is fully vaccinated and 26 percent have gotten boosters, which bolster immunity enough to improve defenses against the original omicron. in the uk, the rates are 71 percent, with 55 percent boosted. but globally, only 52 percent of the world\u2019s population is fully

earning its own greek letter. in that early work, the south african group also identified a ba.3.)", "but while the original omicron roared around the world right away, the second version took a while to rev up. that\u2019s puzzling to scientists, who are waiting for more data. \u201cfrom a virology perspective, it's fascinating,\u201d says nathan grubaugh, a viral epidemiologist and associate professor at the yale school of public health. \u201cthe differences in mutations between ba.1 and ba.2 are similar to the number of differences between alpha and delta. there\u2019s a lot of distance between them. so virologists and evolutionary biologists are asking: where did this come from? how is it so divergent?\u201d", "among the original omicron\u2019s key differences from delta, the variant that emerged in the summer of 2021, are a new ability to infect cells lining the upper airway\u2014the nose and throat, instead of the lungs\u2014along with some enhanced facility for escaping the antibody defenses created by vaccination or prior infection. in combination, those made omicron much more transmissible. as omicron ba.2 takes over, suggesting it\u2019s more transmissible still, the question becomes whether its divergence has allowed it to get better at cell entry and replication or at immune escape.", "the answer could determine what the next phase of the pandemic looks like. \u201cif ba.2 is able to escape immune responses better than ba.1\u2014or if it's able to escape the immune responses that so many people globally just had to ba.1\u2014then we're likely to see

occurrence of devastating illness that marked the earliest waves of the pandemic by keeping the virus from invading the lungs and other organs. data published last week by the us centers for disease control and prevention shows that, even though case numbers and hospitalizations soared during the omicron wave, health care metrics that indicate severe illness\u2014such as the number of days patients stayed in hospitals and whether they were admitted to an icu\u2014actually decreased.", "but whether covid is now intrinsically a more mild disease or has been rendered that way by the blunting effect of immunity from vaccination or infection can\u2019t yet be determined. the emergence of omicron ba.1 and ba.2 were detected by genomic studies, but it\u2019s too soon to have results from the kind of lab assays and population studies that will help untangle whether sars-cov-2 is becoming less virulent as it settles into endemicity. many virologists are skeptical. \u201ci

taken the vaccines. and developing immunity through infection alone risks an unpredictable illness and recovery, or long covid, or the whole-body inflammatory attack in children known as mis-c.", "the simpler answer is to distribute full courses of vaccines, including boosters, as widely as possible. \u201cthe best way to prevent more, more-dangerous, or more-transmissible variants from emerging is

hope that the next variant will not emerge, or that omicron will be a mass immunizing event that will see us to the end of the pandemic.\u201d", "the interplay between vaccines and new variants is visible in a preprint that grubaugh posted online last week, containing the results of a study by yale and university of nebraska researchers of 37,877 pcr-positive covid tests performed as omicron was moving into connecticut. the research, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, shows that two vaccine doses created some defense against delta, forcing the positive test rate down by almost half compared to people who were unvaccinated. adding boosters reduced the positive rate by 83 percent. but among the people who became infected with omicron, significant protection didn\u2019t kick in until after they received boosters\u2014and even then, half of the participants still registered positive on their covid tests.", "the funny thing about that finding was that grubaugh predicted it\u2014last month, in a paper in the journal cell written with sarah cobey, an associate professor at the university of chicago. the authors envisioned that the next successful variant would leapfrog over its predecessors by combining increased transmissibility, the advantage delta possessed, with greater facility for immune escape, the trick deployed by earlier variants. the catch: they thought a newer, more nimble variant would emerge from delta\u2014and not, as omicron did, from a distant branch of the virus\u2019s evolutionary tree.", "grubaugh acknowledges that this constitutes a lesson about the need to think through all the possibilities. \u201cwe lacked the imagination to see that there's some unknown reservoir floating around, in which this virus evolved in such a divergent

abandoning it would lead to a devastating outbreak that would overwhelm the health care system and disrupt social stability. and experts say this is valid\u2014to a certain degree. but the situation is far from straightforward.", "one key challenge is that chinese vaccines are proving to be less effective. while approximately 87 percent of china\u2019s total population is vaccinated, the majority received doses of the country\u2019s homegrown sinovac and sinopharm inactivated-virus vaccines, which use a dead version of the virus to expose the body\u2019s immune system to it. about one-third of the population has also received inactivated-virus booster shots.", "in december, researchers from hong kong found that two doses of sinovac failed to produce enough antibodies to fight omicron.

arrived, china\u2019s vaccines were still some way behind the west\u2019s mrna jabs. the numbers are stark: sinovac is 51 percent effective in preventing symptomatic covid infection. pfizer is 95 percent effective. china has yet to approve pfizer and moderna\u2019s shots for use on the mainland, although shanghai-based fosun pharmaceuticals was given the right to distribute pfizer\u2019s vaccine to hong kong, macau, and taiwan.", "that issue of vaccine effectiveness is compounded by the uneven spread of coverage throughout china. much of the country\u2019s elderly population also remains unvaccinated and vulnerable\u2014due to the government's decision to delay vaccinating seniors in order to prioritize those in high-risk jobs and to ensure the vaccine was safe for older people.

they cannot tolerate even a small number of infections.\u201d", "what has for so long been a point of national pride is now something of a trap. with ineffective vaccines and low protection from previous infections, a large-scale covid outbreak could threaten vulnerable communities and overwhelm china\u2019s health care system. to address this threat, china is adapting. responding to the delta variant in august, the government moved from its initial \u201czero-covid\u201d policy of literally pursuing zero cases to its current \u201cdynamic zero-covid\u201d strategy, which seeks to instead swiftly crack down on outbreaks when they inevitably occur.", "that shift in strategy doesn\u2019t necessarily mean a loosening of restrictions. in the short run, the state will continue enforcing strict measures, like snap lockdowns, because unlike many countries\u2014where lockdowns have become politically and economically unfeasible\u2014china is both able to do so and prepared to pay the cost, according to ben cowling, chair of epidemiology at the university of hong kong. and in purely economic terms, the policy isn\u2019t too much of a drag on china. a recent report by the australia and new zealand banking group found that the dynamic zero-covid approach had shaved just 2.6 percent off the chinese economy in terms of gross domestic product. \u201cchina\u2019s been really good at cracking down and getting to zero,\u201d says cowling. \u201cit\u2019s very disruptive and involves lockdowns, mass testing, and isolation of cases, but that\u2019s affecting a minority of people. if they can limit the spread, i\u2019d say it\u2019s an optimal strategy.\u201d", "as with the rest of the world, china is seeking to buy time so it can use science to beat back the virus\u2014but on its own terms. in the coming months, officials are pinning their hopes on developing better, homegrown mrna vaccines to target omicron and other variants. the current mrna frontrunner, arcov, completed its first-stage clinical trials (on 120 people between the ages of 18 and 59) and was found to have an efficacy rate of 80 to 95 percent, which is on par with pfizer and moderna\u2019s vaccines.", "and arcov might even have a logistical advantage. unlike pfizer and moderna, which are challenging to distribute and store, this mrna vaccine can be kept for six months at a normal refrigerator temperature of between 2 and 8 degrees celsius. pfizer and moderna, by comparison, have to be kept at minus 70 degrees celsius and minus 20 degrees celsius, respectively. experts predict that at least one chinese mrna vaccine could be launched for public use by the end of the year and an omicron-targeting vaccine may be ready in two to six months\u2019 time.", "yet scientists like dongyan jin, a biomedical professor at the university of hong kong, argue that it is \u201ccompletely unwise\u201d to wait for the development of homegrown vaccines instead of simply approving pfizer or moderna. not only will waiting stall the process of building higher immunity in the population, but there\u2019s also no guarantee that homegrown vaccines will be effective. currently being tested in a global phase 3 clinical trial, arcov recently exhibited a sharp drop in neutralizing antibodies against omicron\u2014although a third booster shot did trigger antibody activity in animal tests.", "\u201cthere is no scientific reason for not approving them,\u201d says jin of the pfizer and moderna vaccines, adding that the chinese government has made similar mistakes in the past. jin cites the delayed approval of the human papillomavirus (hpv) vaccines against cervical cancer, which is the third most common cancer among women in china aged 15 to 44 and the sixth most frequent among women overall, as one such example. although the first hpv vaccine was licensed by the us in 2006 and then by 80 more countries a year later, foreign hpv vaccines were only approved in china from 2016 to 2018, due to regulatory delays (china\u2019s food and drug administration required repeated clinical trials to ensure safety and effectiveness prior to approval). china still suffers from a supply shortage of hpv vaccines, even after the country launched its first locally produced hpv vaccine in 2020.", "in the fight against covid, delays could prove even more costly. even if homegrown vaccines are successfully developed, china would still need to make and administer them\u2014though it only took 10 months to jab 1 billion people against covid back in 2021. that\u2019s quick, but huang argues it\u2019s unlikely to be quick enough. \u201cby the time china achieves a high vaccination rate, the omicron-driven wave might already be in retreat,\u201d he says. \u201cwe are likely going to see the emergence and dominance of new variants.\u201d", "so why doesn\u2019t china approve western vaccines? as well as citing the need to protect the domestic market, calvin ho, a bioethicist at the university of hong kong, says the move would also be costly and could trigger a global supply crisis. \u201ceven if they approved pfizer, it\u2019s going to take some time to vaccinate everyone. leaving aside the financial cost, there would be implications of global justice. if china approves it and is prepared to pay, what would be the implications for other countries that cannot afford it?\u201d ho says. \u201crealistically speaking, the way forward may be to hope there will be a more effective vaccine developed in the mainland or hong kong.\u201d", "china\u2019s stance may be shifting. in a surprise move, the country this week conditionally approved pfizer\u2019s paxlovid pill\u2014even though the country is developing its own antiviral drugs and treatments. earlier this month, an antiviral drug called favilavir reportedly received approval to move forward with clinical trials investigating its possible use as a treatment against covid, and the state\u2019s drug authority granted emergency approval for a monoclonal antibody treatment in december. but the latter needs to be administered through injections, which huang says would still put a burden on the health care system, since patients would need to go to the hospital.", "and even if china can develop its own vaccines and treatments, that doesn\u2019t mean it will abandon its dynamic covid-zero strategy, officials have said. \u201cas long as china has no new measures to prevent the imported strains of the coronavirus from triggering large-scale transmission and no effective way to contain the epidemic, the country will not adjust its dynamic zero-tolerance policy,\u201d wu zunyou, chief epidemiologist of the chinese center for disease control and prevention, told state media outfit global times in early february. \u201crelying on vaccines cannot contain covid-19.\u201d", "not everyone agrees a large-scale outbreak would be as disastrous as the state makes it out to be. in fact, there are many steps china can take to mitigate the damage done to vulnerable communities and the health care system as it eases out of a zero-tolerance strategy, experts argue. such measures include introducing more effective vaccines from pfizer and moderna, making more accessible antivirals available for use, and educating the public on the health risks posed by the virus. \u201cif you have these measures in place, you can significantly reduce the risk to make it manageable,\u201d huang says. the cost of maintaining zero-tolerance, he adds, will only increase over time. \u201cyou have to give up that strategy. you can\u2019t expect the virus to disappear.\u201d", "but for all the science, it's impossible to untangle china\u2019s covid response from politics. in the mainland, discussions around china\u2019s zero-tolerance strategy and homegrown vaccines have become highly politicized. scientists advocating for a less strict approach have been attacked on social media, and in january one lawmaker in hong kong said that health experts who promote the idea of \u201cliving with covid\u201d should be seen as violating national security. \u201cthey see this [strategy] as a matter of national pride,\u201d says jin. \u201cmany chinese people are proud.\u201d chinese state media has played a significant role, too, he adds, by creating a partially false narrative around how the rest of the world is suffering.", "pandemic restrictions have also allowed the state to tighten its control over people in china, with security experts saying the virus has become a pretext for the government to accelerate mass surveillance and clamp down on freedom of speech. in february 2020, the government in hangzhou introduced the mandatory alipay health code app that tells people whether they should be quarantined or allowed into certain public spaces. the app, which appears to share information with the police, is now used across china and has become a normalized part of daily life.", "for now, scientists say china will likely only shift away from a zero-tolerance strategy when the population is sufficiently vaccinated with an effective, homegrown, omicron-targeted vaccine. another scenario is that the virus evolves into a form mild enough to allow the country to open up without many casualties\u2014a scenario that is unpredictable, to say the least.", "in the short term, it is unlikely china would risk any such test before the communist party national congress, which is set for this fall. the congress, a major political event ushering in top-level leadership changes that is held every five years, will likely see president xi jinping announce his intention to seek an unprecedented third term in office. as with the rest of the world, the only way for china to end the pandemic is to rely on science. but there's a lot of politics involved too.", "wired is where tomorrow is realized. it is the essential source of information and ideas that make
