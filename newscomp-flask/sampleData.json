release\u00a0it at scale to the U.S., is the\u00a0FDA ready to quickly review\u00a0that data to make this vaccine\u00a0available to the United States?\u201d\n\u201cWe are prepared to look at\u00a0any

that we will look at\u00a0all the data and science,\u00a0it's our job to make sure that\u00a0that data and science show us\u00a0that a vaccine, in this\u00a0particular case, is safe\u00a0and

products including\u00a0vaccines.\u201d\nOn Friday, in a news release, the FDA announced that the agency is continuing to \u201cplay a critical role in accelerating medical countermeasures to treat and prevent COVID-19.\u201d\nCORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW\n\u201cAs part of the response to this pandemic, the agency is taking the lead on a national effort to facilitate the development of, and access to, two investigational therapies derived from human blood,\" the release said.", "\"These are called convalescent plasma and hyperimmune globulin and are antibody-rich blood products made from blood donated by people who have recovered from the virus.\"", "The products can be administered to people diagnosed with COVID-19, according to the FDA, which added that currently there is \u201climited data to suggest that convalescent plasma and hyperimmune globulin may have benefit in the COVID-19 illness.\u201d\nThe FDA stressed that that is why the \"evaluation of these therapies in the context of a clinical trial and expanded access program is so important.\u201d\nOn Sunday, Bartiromo brought up prophylaxis, defined as\u00a0the prevention of a specific disease by studying the biological behavior and transmission of its causative agent and then applying a series of measures against it.", "She asked Hahn, \u201cHow close are you in terms of\u00a0finding the proper prophylaxis\u00a0right now so we can get a shot\u00a0and get immunity for 60 to 90 days\u00a0to eventually open up the\u00a0economy again even if it's temporary?\u201d\nHahn acknowledged that \u201cwe\u00a0absolutely need to get back to\u00a0work\u201d and need to balance that with the public health issues.", "Her question comes as government leaders have\u00a0shut down\u00a0much of the American\u00a0economy in an attempt to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.", "Hahn then brought up that the FDA has been working on convalescent plasma for the past two months.", "\u201cWhat that means is we take\u00a0plasma from a patient who has\u00a0recovered from COVID-19, it has\u00a0all of the immunity in there,\u00a0and then we can give it to\u00a0someone who is sick,\u201d Hahn explained.", "He added that \u201conce we\u00a0determine that that's safe,\u00a0effective, we then move to \u2026 hyperimmune globulin.\u201d \nHahn explained that that process involves pulling plasma \u201cfrom a lot of recovering patients, manufacture it, scale it up and give it as a\u00a0shot.\u201d\nHe went on to say that hyperimmune globulin can work as a therapeutic and potential treatment, but stressed \u201cwe have to study it and we\u2019re doing this quickly.\u201d \nHahn also said \u201cthat there are manufactures,\u00a0great companies in the U.S. that\u00a0have a lot of experience develop[ing] what we call\u00a0monoclonal antibodies, so that's\u00a0actually genetically engineered\u00a0antibodies, different from taking\u00a0it from a patient but against\u00a0the coronavirus, and we have\u00a0been working with them for\u00a0several weeks also, to try\u00a0to scale that up \u2026 as a bridge to get to a\u00a0vaccine.\u201d\nWhen asked if there are any drugs that are currently in short supply in America given some are imported from overseas including China, Hahn said, \u201cRight now, we don't have any\u00a0evidence that there's a drug in\u00a0short supply because of anyone\u00a0blocking the active\u00a0pharmaceutical agreement\u00a0ingredients coming to us.\u201d \nHe added that the FDA is \u201cmonitoring that very\u00a0closely.\u201d\n\u201cI can tell the

system that is the problem -- it is one that works too well.", "Some front line clinicians have speculated that is why steroids, an immune system suppressant, seem to offer benefit in some people.", "Perhaps it is that some younger healthier people, thinking they are not vulnerable to this disease, have been less diligent about practicing physical distancing, and as a result have been exposed to much larger viral loads from the environment.", "To better define the underlying pathology could still take months, and may be variable in patients, no matter their age.", "While it is true that a significant percentage of young people may be at increased risk because Americans have such a high baseline rate of pre-existing diseases such as diabetes, it is the perfectly healthy young people,
