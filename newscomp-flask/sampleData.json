dropping restrictions and that the move was too abrupt. the epidemic could be severe in the coming weeks, she said.\u00a0", "", "but what shocked the country even more was the words of iceland\u2019s chief epidemiologist, thorolfur gudnason. in his memo to the minister of health laying out the rationale for dropping restrictions, gudnason said the main way out of the epidemic is natural herd immunity, or when enough people are immune to the virus that its transmission ceases. in order to achieve this, gudnason wrote, \u201cas many people as possible need to be infected with the virus\u201d because vaccines alone are not enough. (almost 80 percent of iceland\u2019s population has been fully vaccinated.) according to kristjana \u00e1sbj\u00f6rnsd\u00f3ttir, an epidemiologist at the university of iceland, his argument is that if the health care system isn\u2019t overwhelmed, and the omicron wave indeed ends in a few weeks as he is projecting, it may be worth a short-term spike in infections to \u201cget this over

infections.\u201d given that iceland has high vaccine coverage, and that the restrictions required to control the spread of omicron would cause \u201cconsiderable and unforeseen consequences on the

vaccines. for them, omicron might not just cause a sniffly nose; it presents a real danger. dropping mask mandates and vaccination requirements can mean that the world outside their homes will become a no-go zone. \u201cthe complete lifting of all measures, including masks and testing, feels like an unspoken death sentence,\u201d says hans j\u00f3nsson, who is disabled and lives in

second-highest infection rate in the world at the time. but, as jens lundgren, a professor of infectious diseases at the university of copenhagen, says, the virus was no longer considered \u201ca socially critical disease\u201d by the government, meaning it wasn\u2019t threatening critical infrastructure\u2014hospitals, in particular. that being the case, he says, \u201cit would be impossible to continue to argue that it was still necessary to maintain restrictions.\u201d\u00a0", "", "these near-overnight returns to a semblance of pre-pandemic life have triggered serious questions from experts. natural herd immunity, or the total halt of transmission, is an elusive and often-misunderstood concept, says david heymann, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine. achieving herd immunity against covid is a pipe dream, he says, because neither vaccines nor infections offer lifelong immunity or entirely stop transmission. the idea that herd immunity is a viable way out of the pandemic has been widely criticized; the world health organization deemed it \u201cunethical\u201d to allow the spread of a dangerous virus that we don\u2019t fully understand.\u00a0", "", "rather, heymann says, we should be aiming for population immunity\u2014where a certain percentage of people have antibodies against the virus, either from infection, being vaccinated, or both, so that an infection or reinfection doesn't lead to severe illness. in this scenario, the virus still circulates, but it is able to do less damage. achieving population immunity through vaccination is the much safer route, heymann says, as it diminishes the likelihood of long covid in those who get infected.\u00a0", "", "others have echoed \u00e1sbj\u00f6rnsd\u00f3ttir\u2019s concerns, saying that waiting until cases go down to open the country up might be the safer route. tedros adhanom ghebreyesus, the who director-general, warned on february 1 that countries were wrong to assume that because omicron is so transmissible and vaccination increasingly widespread, preventing transmission is \u201cno longer possible, and no longer necessary.\u201d \u201cit\u2019s premature for any country either to surrender or to declare victory,\u201d he said.\u00a0", "", "omicron\u2019s relative mildness\u2014at least among vaccinated populations\u2014might offer a temporary moment of respite, but experts warn that these countries must remain vigilant for other, potentially more pernicious variants that could arise and which may warrant clamping down once again. lundgren acknowledges this: \u201cthe virus has a big say in what will happen, and i, for one, would never lose my guard.\u201d he is sympathetic to the concerns of the most vulnerable but says the situation has changed. \u201cwe also need to appreciate that we are not defenseless,\u201d he says, pointing to the treatments for covid that now exist.\u00a0", "", "to heymann, it comes down to each nation\u2019s risk calculus. \u201ccountries have to make their own decisions. and that's what they're doing,\u201d says heymann. \u201cgovernments have to determine

clung to a zero-covid strategy consisting of strict containment measures that have served the nation remarkably well. china\u2019s official death toll has remained under 5,000, and its total reported

normal\u2014and china\u2019s success at containing the virus has become a source of national pride.", "", "yet the emergence of more infectious variants, like omicron, is changing the calculus. while other countries are responding to covid\u2019s evolution by moving toward a strategy of living with the virus, china continues to rely on some of its harshest restrictions since the outbreak began. surrounding the lunar new year and winter olympics, small but regular outbreaks of the omicron and delta variants have left chinese authorities scrambling. after beijing failed to trace its first local omicron infection in january, its center for disease control and prevention pointed the finger at a mail delivery from canada, prompting various cities to frantically disinfect international mail and test package recipients.", "", "after two years of being a global covid success story, china now appears to be struggling. in the xi\u2019an lockdown, national outrage has followed grocery

certain point,\u201d says fan, whose parents had to quarantine for two weeks at their own expense after meeting a friend who visited a grocery store linked to a single covid case. \u201cit has a huge impact on us.\u201d so why is the government insisting on pursuing a zero-tolerance strategy? the official line is that abandoning it would lead to a devastating outbreak that would overwhelm the health care system and disrupt social stability. and experts say this is valid\u2014to a certain degree. but the situation is far from straightforward.", "", "one key challenge is that chinese vaccines are proving to be less effective. while approximately 87 percent of china\u2019s total population is vaccinated, the majority received doses of the country\u2019s homegrown sinovac and sinopharm inactivated-virus vaccines, which use a dead version of the virus to expose the body\u2019s immune system to it. about one-third of the population has also received inactivated-virus booster shots.", "", "in december, researchers from hong kong found that two doses of sinovac failed to produce enough antibodies to fight omicron. pfizer and moderna\u2019s vaccines, while less effective against omicron than previous strains, still provide substantial protection\u2014especially after three doses. and even before the variants arrived, china\u2019s vaccines were still some way behind the west\u2019s mrna jabs. the numbers are stark: sinovac is 51 percent effective in preventing symptomatic covid infection. pfizer is 95 percent effective. china has yet to approve pfizer and moderna\u2019s shots for use on the mainland, although shanghai-based fosun pharmaceuticals was given the right to distribute pfizer\u2019s vaccine to hong kong, macau, and taiwan.", "", "advertisement", "", "that issue of vaccine effectiveness is compounded by the uneven spread of coverage throughout china. much of the country\u2019s elderly population also remains unvaccinated and vulnerable\u2014due to the government's decision to delay vaccinating seniors in order to prioritize those in high-risk jobs and to ensure the vaccine was safe for older people. (chinese vaccine makers reportedly included fewer elderly people in final-stage trials than did those in the west.) although china opened up vaccinations for seniors aged 60 and above in march, health authorities proceeded cautiously and vaccine hesitancy remains high\u2014nearly nine months after china started offering covid-19 vaccines to people aged 60 and above, about 50 million in this age

sufficient percentage of the population is vaccinated to reach herd immunity,\u201d says yanzhong huang, senior global health fellow at council on foreign relations, a us-based think tank. \u201cbut chinese vaccines are not that effective in preventing infections. they cannot tolerate even a small number of infections.\u201d", "", "what has for so long been a point of national pride is now something of a trap. with ineffective vaccines and low protection from previous infections, a large-scale covid outbreak could threaten vulnerable communities and overwhelm china\u2019s health care system. to address this threat, china is adapting. responding to the delta variant in august, the government moved from its initial \u201czero-covid\u201d policy of literally pursuing zero cases to its current \u201cdynamic zero-covid\u201d strategy, which seeks to instead swiftly crack down on outbreaks when they inevitably occur.", "", "that shift in strategy doesn\u2019t necessarily mean a loosening of restrictions. in the short run, the state will continue enforcing strict measures, like snap lockdowns, because unlike many countries\u2014where lockdowns have become politically and economically unfeasible\u2014china is both able to do so and prepared to pay the cost, according to ben cowling, chair of epidemiology at the university of hong kong. and in purely economic terms, the policy isn\u2019t too much of a drag on china. a recent report by the australia and new zealand banking group found that the dynamic zero-covid approach had shaved just 2.6 percent off the chinese economy in terms of gross domestic product. \u201cchina\u2019s been really good at cracking down and getting to zero,\u201d says cowling. \u201cit\u2019s very disruptive and involves lockdowns, mass testing, and isolation of cases, but that\u2019s affecting a minority of people. if they can limit the spread, i\u2019d say it\u2019s an optimal strategy.\u201d", "", "as with the rest of the world, china is seeking to buy time so it can use science to beat back the virus\u2014but on its own terms. in the coming months, officials are pinning their hopes on developing better, homegrown mrna vaccines to target omicron and other variants. the current mrna frontrunner, arcov, completed its first-stage clinical trials (on 120 people between the ages of 18 and 59) and was found to have an efficacy rate of 80 to 95 percent, which is on par with pfizer and moderna\u2019s vaccines.", "", "and arcov might even have a logistical advantage. unlike pfizer and moderna, which are challenging to distribute and store, this mrna vaccine can be kept for six months at a normal refrigerator temperature of between 2 and 8 degrees celsius. pfizer and moderna, by comparison, have to be kept at minus 70 degrees celsius and minus 20 degrees celsius, respectively. experts predict that at least one chinese mrna vaccine could be launched for public use by the end of the year and an omicron-targeting vaccine may be ready in two to six months\u2019 time.", "", "yet scientists like dongyan jin, a biomedical professor at the university of hong kong, argue that it is \u201ccompletely unwise\u201d to wait for the development of homegrown vaccines instead of simply approving pfizer or moderna. not only will waiting stall the process of building higher immunity in the population, but there\u2019s also no guarantee that homegrown vaccines will be effective. currently being tested in a global phase 3 clinical trial, arcov recently exhibited a sharp drop in neutralizing antibodies against omicron\u2014although a third booster shot did trigger antibody activity in animal tests.", "", "\u201cthere is no scientific reason for not approving them,\u201d says jin of the pfizer and moderna vaccines, adding that the chinese government has made similar mistakes in the past. jin cites the delayed approval of the human papillomavirus (hpv) vaccines against cervical cancer, which is the third most common cancer among women in china aged 15 to 44 and the sixth most frequent among women overall, as one such example. although the first hpv vaccine was licensed by the us in 2006 and then by 80 more countries a year later, foreign hpv vaccines were only approved in china from 2016 to 2018, due to regulatory delays (china\u2019s food and drug administration required repeated clinical trials to ensure safety and effectiveness prior to approval). china still suffers from a supply shortage of hpv vaccines, even after the country launched its first locally produced hpv vaccine in 2020.", "", "in the fight against covid, delays could prove even more costly. even if homegrown vaccines are successfully developed, china would still need to make and administer them\u2014though it only took 10 months to jab 1 billion people against covid back in 2021. that\u2019s quick, but huang argues it\u2019s unlikely to be quick enough. \u201cby the time china achieves a high vaccination rate, the omicron-driven wave might already be in retreat,\u201d he says. \u201cwe are likely going to see the emergence and dominance of new variants.\u201d", "", "so why doesn\u2019t china approve western vaccines? as well as citing the need to protect the domestic market, calvin ho, a bioethicist at the university of hong kong, says the move would also be costly and could trigger a global supply crisis. \u201ceven if they approved pfizer, it\u2019s going to take some time to vaccinate everyone. leaving aside the financial cost, there would be implications of global justice. if china approves it and is prepared to pay, what would be the implications for other countries that cannot afford it?\u201d ho says. \u201crealistically speaking, the way forward may be to hope there will be a more effective vaccine developed in the mainland or hong kong.\u201d", "", "china\u2019s stance may be shifting. in a surprise move, the country this week conditionally approved pfizer\u2019s paxlovid pill\u2014even though the country is developing its own antiviral drugs and treatments. earlier this month, an antiviral drug called favilavir reportedly received approval to move forward with clinical trials investigating its possible use as a treatment against covid, and the state\u2019s drug authority granted emergency approval for a monoclonal antibody treatment in december. but the latter needs to be administered through injections, which huang says would still put a burden on the health care system, since patients would need to go to the hospital.", "", "and even if china can develop its own vaccines and treatments, that doesn\u2019t mean it will abandon its dynamic covid-zero strategy, officials have said. \u201cas long as china has no new measures to prevent the imported strains of the coronavirus from triggering large-scale transmission and no effective way to contain the epidemic, the country will not adjust its dynamic zero-tolerance policy,\u201d wu zunyou, chief epidemiologist of the chinese center for disease control and prevention, told state media outfit global times in early february. \u201crelying on vaccines cannot contain covid-19.\u201d", "", "not everyone agrees a large-scale outbreak would be as disastrous as the state makes it out to be. in fact, there are many steps china can take to mitigate the damage done to vulnerable communities and the health care system as it eases out of a zero-tolerance strategy, experts argue. such measures include introducing more effective vaccines from pfizer and moderna, making more accessible antivirals available for use, and educating the public on the health risks posed by the virus. \u201cif you have these measures in place, you can significantly reduce the risk to make it manageable,\u201d huang says. the cost of maintaining zero-tolerance, he adds, will only increase over time. \u201cyou have to give up that strategy. you can\u2019t expect the virus to disappear.\u201d", "", "but for all the science, it's impossible to untangle china\u2019s covid response from politics. in the mainland, discussions around china\u2019s zero-tolerance strategy and homegrown vaccines have become highly politicized. scientists advocating for a less strict approach have been attacked on social media, and in january one lawmaker in hong kong said that health experts who promote the idea of \u201cliving with covid\u201d should be seen as violating national security. \u201cthey see this [strategy] as a matter of national pride,\u201d says jin. \u201cmany chinese people are proud.\u201d chinese state media has played a significant role, too, he adds, by creating a partially false narrative around how the rest of the world is suffering.", "", "pandemic restrictions have also allowed the state to tighten its control over people in china, with security experts saying the virus has become a pretext for the government to accelerate mass surveillance and clamp down on freedom of speech. in february 2020, the government in hangzhou introduced the mandatory alipay health code app that tells people whether they should be quarantined or allowed into certain public spaces. the app, which appears to share information with the police, is now used across china and has become a normalized part of daily life.", "", "for now, scientists say china will likely only shift away from a zero-tolerance strategy when the population is sufficiently vaccinated with an effective, homegrown, omicron-targeted vaccine. another scenario is that the virus evolves into a form mild enough to allow the country to open up without many casualties\u2014a scenario that is unpredictable, to say the least.", "", "in the short term, it is unlikely china would risk any such test before the communist party national congress, which is set for this fall. the congress, a major political event ushering in top-level leadership changes that is held every five years, will likely see president xi jinping announce his intention to seek an unprecedented third term in office. as with the rest of the world, the only way for china to end the pandemic is to rely on science.

the hospital\u2019s epidemic committee, told the national broadcaster ruv that the government had not consulted with the hospital before dropping restrictions and that the move was too abrupt. the epidemic could be severe in the coming weeks, she said.\u00a0", "but what shocked the country even more was the words of iceland\u2019s chief epidemiologist, thorolfur gudnason. in his memo to the minister of health laying out the rationale for dropping restrictions, gudnason said the main way out of the epidemic is natural herd immunity, or when enough people are immune to the virus that its transmission ceases. in order to achieve this, gudnason wrote, \u201cas many people as possible need to be infected with the virus\u201d because vaccines alone are not enough. (almost 80 percent of iceland\u2019s population has been fully vaccinated.) according to kristjana \u00e1sbj\u00f6rnsd\u00f3ttir, an epidemiologist at the university of iceland, his argument is that if the health care system isn\u2019t overwhelmed, and the omicron wave indeed ends in a few weeks as he is projecting, it may be worth a short-term spike in infections to \u201cget this over with.\u201d\u00a0", "when asked for the rationale behind dropping the restrictions, a spokesperson for the directorate of health, where gudnason works, said that although nobody knows the level at which herd immunity will be obtained, \u201cit is quite evident to us that the only way to get out of this pandemic is by obtaining herd immunity via natural infections.\u201d given that iceland has high vaccine coverage, and that the restrictions required to control the spread of omicron would cause \u201cconsiderable and unforeseen consequences on the society as a whole,\u201d the spokesperson wrote that their office believes \u201creaching herd immunity via the natural process of infection in a highly vaccinated population is justifiable.\u201d\u00a0", "gudnason\u2019s approach deeply

that will allow most things to return to pre-pandemic operations without endangering our most vulnerable.\u201d", "indeed, gudnason\u2019s statement was met with fear and anger by some members of iceland\u2019s clinically vulnerable community. some immunocompromised people do not mount a good\u2014if any\u2014response to vaccines. for them, omicron might not just cause a sniffly nose; it presents a real danger. dropping mask mandates and vaccination requirements can mean that the world outside their homes will become a no-go zone. \u201cthe complete lifting of all measures, including masks and testing, feels like an unspoken death sentence,\u201d says hans j\u00f3nsson, who is disabled and lives in \u00f3lafsfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur, a town in northeast iceland. \u201ci feel like they've

just 62 deaths and around 133,000 cases in total. in the first few months of 2020, its strategy of quashing any outbreaks using painstaking genomic surveillance, testing, and contact tracing was declared a success and a scientific marvel: the country had \u201cbeat the coronavirus,\u201d \u201chammered covid with science,\u201d or\u2014put more elegantly\u2014\u201cscienced the crap outta

kiribati, palau, and tonga meant that the virus\u2019s arrival necessitated a rush to vaccinate their populations, introduce mask mandates, close schools, or institute lockdowns. china, which remains vulnerable to omicron due to the use of less-effective inactivated-virus vaccines, is still pursuing a \u201cdynamic zero-covid\u201d policy that aims to contain outbreaks through strict lockdowns and tracing apps.", "most bizarrely, for the lion\u2019s share of these european countries, including iceland, the decision to roll back restrictions came amid soaring omicron waves. denmark had the second-highest infection rate in the world at the time. but, as jens lundgren, a professor of infectious diseases at the university of copenhagen, says, the virus was no longer considered \u201ca socially critical disease\u201d by the government, meaning it wasn\u2019t threatening critical infrastructure\u2014hospitals, in particular. that being the case, he says, \u201cit would be impossible to continue to argue that it was still necessary to maintain restrictions.\u201d\u00a0", "these near-overnight returns to a semblance of pre-pandemic life have triggered serious questions from experts. natural herd immunity, or the total halt of transmission, is an elusive and often-misunderstood concept, says david heymann, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine. achieving herd immunity against covid is a pipe dream, he says, because neither vaccines nor infections offer lifelong immunity or entirely stop transmission. the idea that herd immunity is a viable way out of the pandemic has been widely criticized; the world health organization deemed it \u201cunethical\u201d to allow the spread of a dangerous virus that we don\u2019t fully understand.\u00a0", "rather, heymann says, we should be aiming for population immunity\u2014where a certain percentage of people have antibodies against the virus, either from infection, being vaccinated, or both, so that an infection or reinfection doesn't lead to severe illness. in this scenario, the virus still circulates, but it is able to do less damage. achieving population immunity through vaccination is the much safer route, heymann says, as it diminishes the likelihood of long covid in those who get infected.\u00a0", "others have echoed \u00e1sbj\u00f6rnsd\u00f3ttir\u2019s concerns, saying that waiting until cases go down to open the country up might be the safer route. tedros adhanom ghebreyesus, the who director-general, warned on february 1 that countries were wrong to assume that because omicron is so transmissible and vaccination increasingly widespread, preventing transmission is \u201cno longer possible, and no longer necessary.\u201d \u201cit\u2019s premature for any country either to surrender or to declare victory,\u201d he said.\u00a0", "omicron\u2019s relative mildness\u2014at least among vaccinated populations\u2014might offer a temporary moment of respite, but experts warn that these countries must remain vigilant for other, potentially more pernicious variants that could arise and which may warrant clamping down once again. lundgren acknowledges this: \u201cthe virus has a big say in what will happen, and i, for one, would never lose my guard.\u201d he is sympathetic to the concerns of the most vulnerable but says the situation has changed. \u201cwe also need to appreciate that we are not defenseless,\u201d he says, pointing to the treatments for covid that now exist.\u00a0", "to heymann, it comes down to each nation\u2019s risk calculus. \u201ccountries have to make their own decisions. and that's what they're doing,\u201d says heymann. \u201cgovernments have to determine

official line is that abandoning it would lead to a devastating outbreak that would overwhelm the health care system and disrupt social stability. and experts say this is valid\u2014to a certain degree. but the situation is far from straightforward.", "one key challenge is that chinese vaccines are proving to be less effective. while approximately 87 percent of china\u2019s total population is vaccinated, the majority received doses of the country\u2019s homegrown sinovac and sinopharm inactivated-virus vaccines, which use a dead version of the virus to expose the body\u2019s immune system to it. about one-third of the population has also received inactivated-virus booster shots.", "in december, researchers from hong kong found that two doses of sinovac failed to produce enough antibodies to fight omicron. pfizer and moderna\u2019s vaccines, while less effective against omicron than previous strains, still provide substantial protection\u2014especially after three doses. and even before the variants arrived, china\u2019s vaccines were still some way behind the west\u2019s mrna jabs. the numbers are stark: sinovac is 51 percent effective in preventing symptomatic covid infection. pfizer is 95 percent effective. china has yet to approve pfizer and moderna\u2019s shots for use on the mainland, although shanghai-based fosun pharmaceuticals was given the right to distribute pfizer\u2019s vaccine to hong kong, macau, and taiwan.", "that issue of vaccine effectiveness is compounded by the uneven spread of coverage throughout china. much of the country\u2019s elderly population also remains unvaccinated and vulnerable\u2014due to the government's decision to delay vaccinating seniors in order to prioritize those in high-risk jobs and to ensure the vaccine was safe for older people.

they cannot tolerate even a small number of infections.\u201d", "what has for so long been a point of national pride is now something of a trap. with ineffective vaccines and low protection from previous infections, a large-scale covid outbreak could threaten vulnerable communities and overwhelm china\u2019s health care system. to address this threat, china is adapting. responding to the delta variant in august, the government moved from its initial \u201czero-covid\u201d policy of literally pursuing zero cases to its current \u201cdynamic zero-covid\u201d strategy, which seeks to instead swiftly crack down on outbreaks when they inevitably occur.", "that shift in strategy doesn\u2019t necessarily mean a loosening of restrictions. in the short run, the state will continue enforcing strict measures, like snap lockdowns, because unlike many countries\u2014where lockdowns have become politically and economically unfeasible\u2014china is both able to do so and prepared to pay the cost, according to ben cowling, chair of epidemiology at the university of hong kong. and in purely economic terms, the policy isn\u2019t too much of a drag on china. a recent report by the australia and new zealand banking group found that the dynamic zero-covid approach had shaved just 2.6 percent off the chinese economy in terms of gross domestic product. \u201cchina\u2019s been really good at cracking down and getting to zero,\u201d says cowling. \u201cit\u2019s very disruptive and involves lockdowns, mass testing, and isolation of cases, but that\u2019s affecting a minority of people. if they can limit the spread, i\u2019d say it\u2019s an optimal strategy.\u201d", "as with the rest of the world, china is seeking to buy time so it can use science to beat back the virus\u2014but on its own terms. in the coming months, officials are pinning their hopes on developing better, homegrown mrna vaccines to target omicron and other variants. the current mrna frontrunner, arcov, completed its first-stage clinical trials (on 120 people between the ages of 18 and 59) and was found to have an efficacy rate of 80 to 95 percent, which is on par with pfizer and moderna\u2019s vaccines.", "and arcov might even have a logistical advantage. unlike pfizer and moderna, which are challenging to distribute and store, this mrna vaccine can be kept for six months at a normal refrigerator temperature of between 2 and 8 degrees celsius. pfizer and moderna, by comparison, have to be kept at minus 70 degrees celsius and minus 20 degrees celsius, respectively. experts predict that at least one chinese mrna vaccine could be launched for public use by the end of the year and an omicron-targeting vaccine may be ready in two to six months\u2019 time.", "yet scientists like dongyan jin, a biomedical professor at the university of hong kong, argue that it is \u201ccompletely unwise\u201d to wait for the development of homegrown vaccines instead of simply approving pfizer or moderna. not only will waiting stall the process of building higher immunity in the population, but there\u2019s also no guarantee that homegrown vaccines will be effective. currently being tested in a global phase 3 clinical trial, arcov recently exhibited a sharp drop in neutralizing antibodies against omicron\u2014although a third booster shot did trigger antibody activity in animal tests.", "\u201cthere is no scientific reason for not approving them,\u201d says jin of the pfizer and moderna vaccines, adding that the chinese government has made similar mistakes in the past. jin cites the delayed approval of the human papillomavirus (hpv) vaccines against cervical cancer, which is the third most common cancer among women in china aged 15 to 44 and the sixth most frequent among women overall, as one such example. although the first hpv vaccine was licensed by the us in 2006 and then by 80 more countries a year later, foreign hpv vaccines were only approved in china from 2016 to 2018, due to regulatory delays (china\u2019s food and drug administration required repeated clinical trials to ensure safety and effectiveness prior to approval). china still suffers from a supply shortage of hpv vaccines, even after the country launched its first locally produced hpv vaccine in 2020.", "in the fight against covid, delays could prove even more costly. even if homegrown vaccines are successfully developed, china would still need to make and administer them\u2014though it only took 10 months to jab 1 billion people against covid back in 2021. that\u2019s quick, but huang argues it\u2019s unlikely to be quick enough. \u201cby the time china achieves a high vaccination rate, the omicron-driven wave might already be in retreat,\u201d he says. \u201cwe are likely going to see the emergence and dominance of new variants.\u201d", "so why doesn\u2019t china approve western vaccines? as well as citing the need to protect the domestic market, calvin ho, a bioethicist at the university of hong kong, says the move would also be costly and could trigger a global supply crisis. \u201ceven if they approved pfizer, it\u2019s going to take some time to vaccinate everyone. leaving aside the financial cost, there would be implications of global justice. if china approves it and is prepared to pay, what would be the implications for other countries that cannot afford it?\u201d ho says. \u201crealistically speaking, the way forward may be to hope there will be a more effective vaccine developed in the mainland or hong kong.\u201d", "china\u2019s stance may be shifting. in a surprise move, the country this week conditionally approved pfizer\u2019s paxlovid pill\u2014even though the country is developing its own antiviral drugs and treatments. earlier this month, an antiviral drug called favilavir reportedly received approval to move forward with clinical trials investigating its possible use as a treatment against covid, and the state\u2019s drug authority granted emergency approval for a monoclonal antibody treatment in december. but the latter needs to be administered through injections, which huang says would still put a burden on the health care system, since patients would need to go to the hospital.", "and even if china can develop its own vaccines and treatments, that doesn\u2019t mean it will abandon its dynamic covid-zero strategy, officials have said. \u201cas long as china has no new measures to prevent the imported strains of the coronavirus from triggering large-scale transmission and no effective way to contain the epidemic, the country will not adjust its dynamic zero-tolerance policy,\u201d wu zunyou, chief epidemiologist of the chinese center for disease control and prevention, told state media outfit global times in early february. \u201crelying on vaccines cannot contain covid-19.\u201d", "not everyone agrees a large-scale outbreak would be as disastrous as the state makes it out to be. in fact, there are many steps china can take to mitigate the damage done to vulnerable communities and the health care system as it eases out of a zero-tolerance strategy, experts argue. such measures include introducing more effective vaccines from pfizer and moderna, making more accessible antivirals available for use, and educating the public on the health risks posed by the virus. \u201cif you have these measures in place, you can significantly reduce the risk to make it manageable,\u201d huang says. the cost of maintaining zero-tolerance, he adds, will only increase over time. \u201cyou have to give up that strategy. you can\u2019t expect the virus to disappear.\u201d", "but for all the science, it's impossible to untangle china\u2019s covid response from politics. in the mainland, discussions around china\u2019s zero-tolerance strategy and homegrown vaccines have become highly politicized. scientists advocating for a less strict approach have been attacked on social media, and in january one lawmaker in hong kong said that health experts who promote the idea of \u201cliving with covid\u201d should be seen as violating national security. \u201cthey see this [strategy] as a matter of national pride,\u201d says jin. \u201cmany chinese people are proud.\u201d chinese state media has played a significant role, too, he adds, by creating a partially false narrative around how the rest of the world is suffering.", "pandemic restrictions have also allowed the state to tighten its control over people in china, with security experts saying the virus has become a pretext for the government to accelerate mass surveillance and clamp down on freedom of speech. in february 2020, the government in hangzhou introduced the mandatory alipay health code app that tells people whether they should be quarantined or allowed into certain public spaces. the app, which appears to share information with the police, is now used across china and has become a normalized part of daily life.", "for now, scientists say china will likely only shift away from a zero-tolerance strategy when the population is sufficiently vaccinated with an effective, homegrown, omicron-targeted vaccine. another scenario is that the virus evolves into a form mild enough to allow the country to open up without many casualties\u2014a scenario that is unpredictable, to say the least.", "in the short term, it is unlikely china would risk any such test before the communist party national congress, which is set for this fall. the congress, a major political event ushering in top-level leadership changes that is held every five years, will likely see president xi jinping announce his intention to seek an unprecedented third term in office. as with the rest of the world, the only way

became readily available, according to a new york times database.", "hong kong, which is going through its worst outbreak yet, has also fallen short on vaccinating its people, particularly older residents. florence chang, a financial planner, said her 95-year-old father contracted the virus from a health aide last month and was hospitalized. he suffers from diabetes, sleep apnea and hypertension, and was advised by his doctor not to get vaccinated, she said.", "\u201cthe thought that he might not be with us, with the family, is quite difficult,\u201d said ms. chang, 54. \u201cif he gets better, we will definitely spend more time together.\u201d", "and stark vaccination disparities between countries remain, leaving the entire world vulnerable to the threat of a new, deadly

percent of the population has received at least one dose.", "\u201cscience has given us tools to fight this virus our ancestors could not even have dreamed of \u2014 the ability to track its evolution

addition, the department strongly recommends that students or staff members who are exposed to the virus wear face coverings, although it does not require them to do so.", "as the omicron surge has waned, pandemic restrictions have been lifted in many states, including new york, allowing local officials to make their own determinations on masks. on monday, mr. adams also lifted a citywide requirement for proof of vaccination in many places indoors, including restaurants and gyms. in connecticut, the decision was turned over to localities late last month, while in new jersey, rules similar to new york\u2019s took effect on monday. chicago, home to the nation\u2019s third largest public school system, announced monday that it would make masks in schools optional next week.",

rates among children have continued to lag, and are not consistent from one school to another.", "a recent study from the state health department found that, as with adults, most children hospitalized for or with covid-19 were unvaccinated. the report also found that children aged 4 or younger, who are not eligible for coronavirus vaccines, were overrepresented among all pediatric hospitalizations. masks are still required in new york city for children ages 2 to 4 in kindergarten and preschool classrooms.", "the united federation of teachers, which represents the city\u2019s public school educators, said on friday that it supported moving to a system where masks are optional. president michael mulgrew called it \u201cthe responsible, thoughtful way to make our next transition.\u201d",

schools, remained \u201con the right path.\u201d", "some parents, public health experts, and local officials have said that it was too early to ease restrictions, and some have urged children and
