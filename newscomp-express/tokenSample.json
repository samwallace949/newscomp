The unanimous vote will pave the way for an expected authorization of the booster by the FDA and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Unlike the recently sanctioned booster for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, however, Moderna’s booster will come as a half-dose.","","ADVERTISEMENT","Outside experts with the FDA’s vaccine advisory committee met Thursday and are meeting again tomorrow to hash out lingering questions about booster doses for Americans. Though a Pfizer booster dose was authorized last month for people over 65 and high-risk individuals, it only covered those who originally took the Pfizer vaccine.","","Thursday’s meeting was all about the Moderna vaccine. That shot is based on the same mRNA technology as Pfizer’s, and they seem to have a similar level of effectiveness in preventing death and illness from the coronavirus. But there’s been less real-world data collected on the Moderna vaccine than Pfizer’s, despite it being authorized in the U.S. only a week after Pfizer’s shot last winter (in August this year, Pfizer’s vaccine became the first to win full FDA approval).","","The panel experts were concerned about a lack of real-world data supporting a Moderna booster shot, compared to the data available on Pfizer (in Israel, Pfizer boosters have been available for months). Moderna did present data from a small booster dose study, the New York Times reported, which found that people’s antibody levels to the coronavirus rose after getting a booster. But the experts also noted the many similarities between the two vaccines, and, given the data to date as well as Pfizer’s earlier go-ahead, they concluded that there was no rationale for rejecting Moderna’s application.","","“In some ways I support this EUA because we’ve already approved for Pfizer and I don’t see how we can possibly not approve it for Moderna, and not have most U.S. folks be completely confused,” said Stanley Perlman, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Iowa and committee member, during the meeting.","","There are some subtle but possibly important differences between the two vaccines, though. Unlike Pfizer, Moderna didn’t try to argue that a booster would be needed to prevent the waning of immunity against severe illness and hospitalization. Some data has suggested that the Moderna vaccine remains more potent over time, possibly due to the higher doses it uses. It’s this higher dose that also led Moderna to cut the dose in half for the booster. There’s mixed evidence on whether vaccine-provided immunity to covid-19 has significantly declined in the general public, though there is a stronger case for waning now in older people who got shots last winter.","","The recommendations of these advisory committees don’t automatically become policy, though the FDA rarely disagrees with them. So for now, it’s likely that boosters of the mRNA vaccines will remain prioritized for people over 65 and high-risk groups, such as people with compromised immune systems and healthcare workers who might be more frequently exposed to the virus. But it’s still unclear what the verdict tomorrow will be for the J&J vaccine, which has shown less effectiveness in general as a single dose. Panel experts will not only discuss whether a J&J booster is needed but whether those booster doses should be given two months or six months after the first.","","ADVERTISEMENT","SCIENCE","HEALTH","COVID-19","DISCUSSION","Byfaithful-dushness","big pharma has struck a gold mine with covid, all the reward, with zero liability.","","","See all 10 comments",""],"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/07/us/politics/pfizer-fda-authorization-children-5-11.html":["SKIP TO CONTENTSKIP TO SITE INDEX","Log In","The Coronavirus","Pandemic","LIVECovid-19 Updates","Coronavirus Map and Cases","World Vaccination Tracker","Vaccine FAQ","ADVERTISEMENT","","Continue reading the main story","","Pfizer Asks F.D.A. to Authorize Its Covid-19 Vaccine for Children 5 to 11","The agency has promised to move quickly on the request and  tentatively plans to meet on Oct. 26 to consider it.

Kennedy.","","The White House statement, signed by President Biden, did not make clear exactly how the coronavirus had delayed the release of the records, which must be released to comply with a 1992 congressional act, but said that the national archivist reported that the pandemic had a “significant impact on the agencies” that need to be consulted on redactions. A National Security Council spokesman said classified material could not be viewed remotely.","","The archivist of the United States directs the National Archives and Records Administration, the repository of public governmental records. The position has been held since 2009 by David S. Ferriero, a former librarian at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Duke University and the New York Public Library. He is the 10th person in the role since the National Archives were established in 1934.","","The White House statement said that the National Archives required additional time to conduct research and work with the agencies, which include the Defense, Justice and State departments.","","The assassination of the 35th president, on Nov. 22, 1963, still holds a grip on the public imagination. It has also been the subject of an endless stream of conspiracy theories.","","Despite a yearlong inquiry into the murder — led by Chief Justice Earl Warren — that concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone, surveys over the years have consistently found that most Americans believe others were involved. A House select committee said in a 1979 report that there was evidence suggesting the possibility of a conspiracy.","","Image","","The United Press International bulletin alerting the news media that the president had been shot, “perhaps seriously, perhaps fatally.”Credit...Christopher Gregory/The New York Times","The 1992 law required the government to make public the last of the Kennedy assassination documents by Oct. 26, 2017, unless the sitting president opted to withhold any for national security reasons. The Trump administration did release a trove of J.F.K. assassination records in the fall of that year. While the documents have been intriguing to researchers and conspiracy theorists alike, they have not conclusively changed the previous understanding of the assassination.","","Mr. Trump, who himself has dabbled in an assassination conspiracy, claiming that the father of onetime rival Ted Cruz was somehow involved in Kennedy’s murder, pushed back the release date of some records to 2021.","","In the White House statement on Friday, President Biden said he agreed with the archivist’s recommendation that records be withheld from public disclosure until December 2022.","","“Temporary continued postponement,” he said, “is necessary to protect against identifiable harm to the military defense, intelligence operations, law enforcement, or the conduct of foreign relations that is of such gravity that it outweighs the public interest in immediate disclosure.”","","The White House also said it wanted to make the J.F.K. documents more accessible. More than 250,000 records — more than 90 percent of the records agency’s collection on the assassination — have been publicly released and “only a small fraction” contain redactions. But many of the records can be viewed by the public only at a National Archives site in College Park, Md.","","The White House statement also ordered the archivist to create a plan to digitize and make available online the records agency’s entire collection of J.F.K. assassination documents.","","Read more","Tracking the Coronavirus ›","United States ›\tUnited StatesAvg. on Oct. 26\t14-day change","New cases\t70,824\t–23%\t","New deaths\t1,401\t–17%\t","World ›\tWorldAvg. on Oct. 26\t14-day change","New cases\t409,534\t–1%\t","New deaths\t7,015\t–2%\t","U.S. hot spots ›","","Vaccinations ›","","Global hot spots ›","","Global vaccinations ›","","Other trackers: Choose your own places","Global vaccinations","Australia","U.K.","Alaska","Mont.","Idaho","Hospitals","Vaccine development","Other trackers:","Global vaccinations","Australia","U.K.","Alaska","Mont.","Idaho","Hospitals","Vaccine development","Choose your own places","Spain will reimburse thousands of people fined during 2020 lockdown.","By Raphael Minder","MADRID, Spain — The government will reimburse hundreds of thousands of residents who were fined for violating the rules of last year’s Covid-19 lockdown amid a surge of infections.","","The measure, announced Friday by the ministry of territorial affairs, is set to benefit those who paid about 1.1 million fines in the spring of 2020. At the time, Spain found itself on the front line of the pandemic and imposed one of Europe’s toughest lockdowns, including on children, who were kept inside, unable to exercise or even go on errands with their parents.","","The decision comes after Spain’s Constitutional Court ruled in July that the government had overstepped its powers and violated the rights of citizens to freedom of movement when it decreed a state of emergency in March 2020.","","Although not all those who were penalized paid the fines, the government estimated in July that it had collected about 115 million euros during Spain’s initial state of emergency, which lasted three months.","","In its ruling, the court’s panel did not condemn the government for forcing people to stay at home to stop the spread of the coronavirus, but the judges struck down the government’s interpretation of its right to decree a state of emergency as well as some specific measures, including stopping people from leaving their official residences to spend the lockdown in a second home.","","The ruling followed a complaint filed by Spain’s far-right opposition party, Vox. Spain’s constitutional court must still issue a final ruling over the legality of the country’s second state of emergency, which was intended to contain another spike in Covid-19 cases and ran from November 2020 to May 2021.","","ADVERTISEMENT","Continue reading the main story","Here are the lessons experts have taken from the five waves of the coronavirus in the U.S.","By Lauren Leatherby","The United States has suffered through five waves of the coronavirus pandemic now, depending on how one counts. Experts say what comes next is hard to predict, but looking back at the outbreak so far can provide some clues about how the virus may spread in the future.","","“Each of these waves has a different complexity and pattern,” said Alessandro Vespignani, the director of the Network Science Institute at Northeastern University in Boston.","","","What Previous Covid-19 Waves Tell Us About the Virus Now","Looking back at the outbreak so far can provide some clues about how the virus may spread in the future.","","During the first wave, for instance, strict stay-at-home measures and drastic changes in behavior may have stalled the virus for a time. Last fall, with those measures and behavior comparatively relaxed, record-breaking surges in the Midwest rippled outward to the South and both coasts. By the time the highly contagious Delta variant fueled a wave across the country this summer, vaccines were widely available, shifting the pattern once again.","","“Vaccines have clearly changed which places have been hit and how much they’ve been hit,” said Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University.","","The most recent wave, this time fueled by the Delta variant, began in June when states lifted virtually all virus restrictions and people relaxed their behavior in celebration. Missouri saw the first big surge, then that moved across Arkansas, then Louisiana, both states with low vaccination rates.","","Some experts say that the vaccination campaign and much of the country having already experienced several waves of outbreaks — which have conferred some immunity to those who were infected and recovered — have made them cautiously optimistic for the winter. Few experts are forecasting a substantial winter peak.","","“We might see a little bump in cases, and of course people could radically change behavior or we could see a variant,” said Justin Lessler, a professor of epidemiology at the University of North Carolina.","","Read more","Regulators at the F.D.A. say the Pfizer vaccine’s benefits outweigh the key risks for 5- to 11-year-olds.","","Image","","Lydia Melo, 7, getting a shot of the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine during a trial at Duke University in Durham, N.C., in September.Credit...Shawn Rocco/Duke University, via Reuters","By Sharon LaFraniere and Noah Weiland","WASHINGTON — Federal regulators evaluated for the first time on Friday the safety and efficacy of a coronavirus vaccine for children 5 to 11, saying that the benefits of staving off Covid-19 with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine generally outweighed the risks of the most worrisome possible side effects in that age group.","","The analysis came on the same day that the Food and Drug Administration posted data from Pfizer showing that the vaccine had a 90.7 percent efficacy rate in preventing symptomatic Covid-19 in a clinical trial of 5- to 11-year-olds.","","The findings could add momentum for F.D.A. authorization of the pediatric dose on an emergency basis, perhaps as early as next week, opening up a long-awaited new phase of the nation’s vaccination campaign. The agency’s independent vaccine expert committee is set to vote Tuesday on whether to recommend authorization.","","In a briefing document posted on the F.D.A. website, the agency said it had balanced the dangers of hospitalization, death or other serious consequences from Covid-19 against the risk of side effects. That included myocarditis, a rare condition involving inflammation of the heart muscle that has been linked to the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, especially among young men.","","“The overall analysis predicted that the numbers of clinically significant Covid-19-related outcomes prevented would clearly outweigh the numbers of vaccine-associated excess myocarditis cases,” regulators wrote.","","As is customary, the regulators took no stance on whether the new use of a vaccine should be authorized.","","If the F.D.A. rules in favor of authorization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and its own panel of vaccine experts agree, the 28 million children in that age group could become eligible for shots in the first week of November.","","“There’s a lot of data to be encouraged by,” said Dr. Kathryn M. Edwards, a professor of pediatrics in the division of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. She said the results exceeded the protection offered by the best flu vaccine and could eventually lead to the easing of restrictions intended to prevent elementary school children from contracting the virus.","","Read more","ADVERTISEMENT","Continue reading the main story","Here’s what you need to know to navigate the C.D.C.’s new mix-and-match vaccine strategy.","","Image","","The approval of the mix-and-match approach for coronavirus vaccine booster shots left Americans with many questions.Credit...Jim Wilson/The New York Times","By Apoorva Mandavilli","The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Thursday that Americans could choose a booster dose of a vaccine different from the one they had initially received — the so-called mix-and-match strategy.","","Is there an advantage to mixing vaccines?","Preliminary evidence strongly suggests that mixing two Covid vaccine types produces a stronger immune response than matching the booster to the initial vaccine.","","Booster doses of an mRNA vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna) seem to raise antibody levels higher than a booster dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.","","Image","","A pop-up vaccination clinic in West Palm Beach, Fla., in August.

While much has been made about pandemic learning loss, social and emotional wellness is also a key part of school that feels under-discussed.","","All of the teachers I spoke to have more than a decade of teaching experience, and they teach in a variety of settings: urban, rural and suburban, with varied demographics in their districts. It’s important to first note that everyone said, overall, their students are happy to be back in the classroom, connecting with their friends. While they described a variety of new challenges to this school year, the other consistent response is that many kids in their classrooms are socially and emotionally anywhere from six to 18 months behind where they are in a normal year.","","Amanda Marsden, a second grade teacher in Cape Elizabeth, Maine, a town of around 9,000 people outside of Portland, said that her second graders have never had a “normal” school year, since the pandemic hit in the spring of kindergarten for them, so they need to be taught some of the basics of being in a classroom again. “We’re really breaking down the minutiae of the day,” she said. Her students are also much quicker to run to a teacher with a problem than working it out themselves, she added — they got used to having a grown-up around to solve disputes when they were learning at home.","","Children also may be acting out in new ways to get that adult attention. “We actually just had a student start a fire in a school bathroom last week. THAT was a first for everyone in my building!” Nicole Hagle, who teaches seventh and eighth grade English in Mt. Pleasant, Mich., a college town in the middle of the state, wrote to me in an email. When I followed up with her on the phone, she said that the fire is just one of the attention-seeking behaviors she’s observed — there’s more yelling, more cursing, more acting out. “We’re having to dial back expectations behaviorally,” she said.","","The pandemic, paired with natural disasters, drives a record number of illegal U.S. border crossings.","","Image","","Migrants were lined up and processed by Border Patrol north of the Roma–Ciudad Miguel Aleman International Bridge, which spans the Rio Grande border with Mexico, in Roma, Texas, U.S. October 1, 2021Credit...Jason Garza/Via Reuters","By Eileen Sullivan and Miriam Jordan","A record 1.7 million migrants from around the world, many of them fleeing pandemic-ravaged countries, were encountered trying to enter the United States illegally in the last 12 months. The tally capped a year of chaos at the southern border, which has emerged as one of the most formidable challenges for the Biden administration.","","It was the highest number of illegal crossings recorded since at least 1960, when the government first began tracking such entries. The number was similarly high for the 2000 fiscal year, when border agents caught 1.6 million people, according to government data.","","Single adults represented the largest group of those detained in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, at 1.1 million, or 64 percent of all crossers. There were also large numbers of migrant families — more than 479,000, which is about 48,000 fewer than during the last surge in family crossings in 2019.","","But the nearly 147,000 children whom agents encountered without parents or guardians was the largest number since 2008, when the government started tallying unaccompanied minors.","","The crossers hailed from around the globe, many of them seeking economic opportunity as the coronavirus pandemic erased hundreds of millions of jobs. Agents caught people from more than 160 countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America, with Mexico accounting for the largest share.","","In addition to the pandemic, two hurricanes destroyed livelihoods and homes in Guatemala and Honduras, where extortion and violence from gangs have persisted in many communities, further fueling an exodus.","","A public health rule, invoked by President Donald J. Trump at the beginning of the pandemic in 2020 to seal the border, has remained in place under the Biden administration. Over the last 12 months, the Border Patrol has carried out more than one million expulsions of migrants back to Mexico or to the migrants’ home countries.","","President Biden has walked a fine line between trying to control the influx and put in place a more humane approach to border enforcement. Republicans have blamed Mr. Biden’s promises to reverse Trump-era immigration policies for fueling the surge, as word spread that the country’s borders had become easier to breach.","","Read more","ADVERTISEMENT","Continue reading the main story","France recommends flu and Covid booster shots in the same visit.","","Image","","Administering a Pfizer booster shot at a nursing home in Strasbourg, France, in September.

So those eligible for a Covid booster dose in France can receive it in one arm and a flu shot in the other on the same day. France has offered booster shots to people over age 65, pregnant women, people with certain comorbidities and recipients of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.","","Dr. Olivier Véran, the French health minister, went on TV on Friday to advocate getting both vaccines during one appointment.","","“Already, 10 million doses are available in pharmacies, prioritized for the most vulnerable people,” he said. “This vaccination can be done at the same time as that against Covid.”","","The new effort is expected to bolster the drive for Covid vaccines, in addition to encouraging those at risk to get the booster shots. So far, 68 percent of the people in France are fully vaccinated, according to the Our World in Data project at the University of Oxford.","","Health officials in other countries have also urged people to get vaccinated against both Covid-19 and the flu before winter.","","On Friday, the British government started a national advertising campaign on billboards, radio stations, TV channels and social media platform urging people to get both vaccines.","","“This is the first winter when Covid-19 and seasonal flu are expected to be circulating together, putting more lives at risk,” said Dr. Mary Ramsay, the chief of immunization at the U.K. Health Security Agency, in a statement. “Vaccinations are important to protect against both diseases.”","","Britain began offering booster shots against Covid last month to people ages 50 and older, health and social care workers and others with medical conditions that put them at higher risk of severe illness.","","City and state health departments in the United States have similarly encouraged people to get vaccinated against both viral diseases at the same time. Though some clinics only offer Covid shots, both flu and Covid vaccines are widely available at many pharmacies.","","Some local health agencies have specifically promoted getting them in one trip. The city of West Hollywood, for example, held an outdoor clinic on Thursday, offering Covid vaccines and flu shots together. A health center in Grand Rapids, Mich., held a drive-through clinic earlier this month, administering Covid booster and flu shots.","","Administering both together makes getting immunized more convenient for patients and eases the burden on clinics, because fewer appointments are needed, officials have said.","","Read more","NEWS ANALYSIS","","Biden’s popularity rating falls, but the pandemic is a bright spot.","","Image","","President Biden and Vice President Kamala D. Harris at the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial in Washington on Thursday.Credit...Doug Mills/The New York Times","By Nate Cohn","President Biden’s approval ratings have declined on nearly every issue and among nearly every demographic group in national surveys over the last two months, as the promise of a return to normalcy has given way to rising inflation, a simmering pandemic, gridlock in Washington and chaos on the border and in Afghanistan.","","Still, Mr. Biden’s handling of the coronavirus continues to be a relative political bright spot. Polls show that most voters approve of his requirement that employees of large companies either get a vaccine or take a test. But his ratings on the virus have nonetheless declined since the summer, as the Delta variant dashed any hopes of a quick end to the pandemic.","","By one measure, the pandemic was now only the eighth most concerning issue to voters, even trailing hot-button cultural issues like the southern border and what’s taught in public schools.","","Over all, however, the president’s approval ratings have sunk into the low- to mid-40s, putting him into rather lonely historical company. In the era of modern polling, only Donald J. Trump had a lower approval rating at this early stage of his term.","","There’s no evidence the damage to Mr. Biden is irreparable.","","Many presidents have won re-election after watching their ratings fall to similar depths during their first two years in office. Voters can have a short memory. And while President Biden’s losses have been pronounced among reliable Democratic constituencies, such as young, Latino and even Black voters, those groups can also be relatively easy for Democrats to win back.","","Read more","ADVERTISEMENT","Continue reading the main story","A limited C.D.C. study finds no significant change in hospitalization outcomes during the U.S. Delta wave.","","Image","","A Covid patient in an intensive care unit at Providence Sacred Heart Medical Center in Spokane, Wash., in September.Credit...Grant Hindsley for The New York Times","By Benjamin Mueller","Scientists from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday took aim at the question of whether the Delta variant of the coronavirus causes more severe disease, finding no significant differences in the course of hospitalized patients’ illnesses during the Delta wave compared to earlier in the pandemic.","","But larger and more detailed studies from a number of other countries have found that people with Delta infections were considerably more likely to be hospitalized in the first place — a trend that the C.D.C. study was unable to address because of limitations in its data. The C.D.C. study also said that the proportion of older hospitalized patients needing intensive care or dying had shown some signs of increasing during the Delta wave.","","Delta’s higher level of infectiousness has made it a far greater challenge than earlier versions of the virus, but the question of whether it also causes more serious disease has loomed as it swept around the world. The Alpha variant, an earlier version first detected in Britain, appeared to be linked to a higher risk of death, though scientists have also tried to understand whether factors besides the variant were playing a role.","","Studies in England, Scotland, Canada and Singapore suggested that the Delta variant was associated with more severe illness, a finding that scientists have said raises the risk that outbreaks of the variant in unvaccinated areas may put a bigger burden on health systems. Unlike the C.D.C. study, those studies drew on genomic sequencing, allowing researchers to distinguish infections with the Delta variant and to track patients from before they enter a hospital.","","Without access to sequencing data, the C.D.C. researchers could not determine which variants the patients may have been infected with. It also examined patients already admitted to hospitals, making it impossible to determine whether they were at higher risk of needing hospital care in the first place.","","The study, released on Friday, examined roughly 7,600 Covid hospitalizations, comparing July and August — when Delta dominated — to earlier months this year, and found no significant change in hospitalized patients’ outcomes.","","The study said that the proportion of hospitalized patients aged 50 and older who died or were admitted to intensive care “generally trended upward in the Delta period,” though the differences were not statistically significant and further work was needed. At the hospitals included in the study, roughly 70 percent of Covid patients were unvaccinated.","","The researchers said the findings matched those of other C.D.C. studies using similar methods that showed no significant differences in the outcomes of younger people hospitalized before and during the Delta surge.","","Outside scientists questioned the reliability of the study.","","Dr. David Fisman, an epidemiologist at the University of Toronto, ran a larger study that found that people infected with the Delta variant had roughly twice the risk of hospitalization as people infected with variants that had not been labeled a concern. He said that such analyses needed to control for the range of factors that affect the course of Covid patients’ illnesses, and that the availability of vaccines, testing and treatments had all been changing during the pandemic.","","“As this is the U.S. C.D.C., I’m really surprised at the small sample sizes for individuals with more detailed clinical information, as well as the use of such rudimentary statistical methods to deal with these data,” he said.","","Dr. Fisman’s study, drawing on 200,000 cases and published this month, also showed significantly increased risks of intensive care admission and death among those infected with the Delta variant, after accounting for their age, sex, vaccination status and other factors.","","Roughly 70 percent of people with Delta infections in the study were unvaccinated, and 28 percent were partially vaccinated. Fully vaccinated people are heavily protected from Covid.","","Similarly, a study in Scotland from June based on 20,000 Covid cases showed that Delta infections were associated with an 85 percent higher risk of hospitalization, though it allowed for a wide degree of uncertainty about the precise figure.","","And data from England, drawn from 43,000 cases and published in August, found that people infected with the Delta variant were just over twice as likely to be hospitalized as people with the Alpha variant, though the researchers in that study, too, were unsure of the precise figure.","","Roughly three-quarters of the patients in that study were unvaccinated, and most of the rest were only partially vaccinated.","","Read more","New Zealand wants a 90% vaccination rate.

But two things have changed since then. The first is that Delta has made it very hard to maintain our elimination strategy. Its tentacles have reached into our communities and made it hard to shake, even using the best public health measures and the toughest restrictions we had available to us. But right as our long-standing strategy was challenged, we also had a new tool, one that means as Covid has changed, we could change too. And rather than being locked down, we could move forward safely and with confidence. That tool is the vaccine. Basically, if you want to be guaranteed that no matter the setting that we are in, that you can go to bars, restaurants and close-proximity businesses like a hairdresser, you will need to be vaccinated.","","","Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern of New Zealand stressed the importance of vaccinations as the country moved away from lockdowns, announcing a new, color-coded system of restrictions to be implemented when the country reaches its vaccination target.CreditCredit...Phil Walter/Getty Images","By Natasha Frost","Rawiri Jansen, a Maori doctor, had an urgent message for the 150 people, mostly patch-wearing members of New Zealand’s plentiful street gangs and their families, who sat before him on a bright Saturday afternoon.","","Covid-19 is coming for them, he said. Cases in New Zealand’s hospitals are rising rapidly. Soon, dozens of new infections a day might become hundreds or even a thousand. People will die. And vaccination is the only defense. “When your doctors are scared, you should be scared,” he said.","","By the end of the day, after an exhaustive question-and-answer session with other health professionals, roughly a third of those present chose to receive a dose then and there.","","Having abandoned its highly successful “Covid-zero” elimination strategy in response to an outbreak of the Delta variant, New Zealand is undergoing a difficult transition to trying to keep coronavirus cases as low as possible. On Friday, the country set a target of getting at least 90 percent of the eligible population fully vaccinated — a goal, the highest in the developed world, whose success hinges on persuading people like those who gathered to hear Dr. Jansen.","","Already, 86 percent of the eligible population has received at least one dose. But the final few percent are the most difficult to reach, and one group of particular concern is the gang community, many of whose members are Maori or Pacific Islanders, who make up about a quarter of the overall population. In the past two months, multiple outbreaks have been reported among gangs, a subset of the population less likely to comply with official vaccination efforts, forcing officials to cooperate with gang leaders to reach their communities.","","Site Information Navigation","© 2021 The New York Times Company","NYTCoContact UsAccessibilityWork with usAdvertiseT Brand StudioYour Ad ChoicesPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapHelpSubscriptions",""],"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/pfizer-biontech-ask-us-regulators-ok-covid-19-vaccine-kids-2021-10-07/":["WorldBusinessLegal MarketsMore","","Sign In","Register","October 7, 2021","6:38 PM EDT","Last Updated 20 days ago","United States","Pfizer, BioNTech seek U.S. COVID-19 vaccine clearance for children 5-11","Reuters","","","","","","3 minute read","WASHINGTON, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and BioNTech SE have asked U.S. regulators to authorize emergency use of their COVID-19 vaccine for children ages 5 to 11, a group for whom no shot is currently allowed, Pfizer said on Thursday.","","The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has set a date of Oct. 26 for its panel of outside advisers to meet and discuss the application, making it possible for children in this age group - numbering around 28 million - to begin receiving the two-dose Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine shortly afterward.","","\"With new cases in children in the U.S. continuing to be at a high level, this submission is an important step in our ongoing effort against #COVID19,\" Pfizer wrote on Twitter.","","The vaccine already has won U.S. emergency use authorization in teens ages 12 to 15 and is fully approved by regulators for people ages 16 and up.","","The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is one of three in use in the United States, along with the two-dose Moderna (MRNA.O) vaccine and the single-dose Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) version, neither of which has won full regulatory approval for any age group.","","A rapid authorization of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in young kids could help mitigate a potential surge of cases in the coming weeks and months, with schools open nationwide and colder weather driving activities indoors. If given regulatory authorization, the two-dose Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine would become the first COVID-19 shot made available to children 5 to 11 in the United States.","","The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine has been shown to induce a strong immune response in 5 to 11 year olds in a 2,268-participant clinical trial, the companies said on Sept. 20. read more","","","","1/3","Lydia Melo, 7, is inoculated with one of two reduced 10 ug doses of the Pfizer BioNtech COVID-19 vaccine during a trial at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina September 28, 2021 in a still image from video.

How much should people be worrying?","","\"I think that we expect that immunity will slowly wane, over time, but it's not a reason for people to panic,\" said Dr. Ann Falsey, a specialist in viral respiratory diseases at the University of Rochester School of Medicine.","","5 things to know about coronavirus booster shots","\"It's not like suddenly one day you're completely susceptible, like you were before you were vaccinated,\" added Falsey, who is helping lead clinical trials of Covid-19 vaccines.","\"The vaccines are all standing up pretty well -- Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson -- for severe disease,\" Falsey told CNN. \"Now, that's not to say that we might not eventually get to a point where we really need people to get boosters to prevent more severe illness. But, really, the majority of the breakthrough infections are colds, maybe flu-like illness -- not the scary illnesses that we were facing before,\" she added.","\"So my main message is, don't panic. You're going to be okay.\"","That hasn't stopped Americans from flocking to get boosters. This past week more people were getting booster shots than were getting their first round of a coronavirus vaccine. By Friday, more than 7 million Americans had received either booster shots or the third round of vaccines authorized for people with immunocompromising conditions who likely did not get adequate responses to the first two shots.","","More people are getting Covid-19 vaccine boosters than getting their first shots, CDC data shows","This week, two more studies added to the growing evidence that immunity from Pfizer's vaccine drops off.","One study from Israel covered 4,800 health care workers and showed antibody levels wane rapidly after two doses of vaccine, \"especially among men, among persons 65 years of age or older, and among persons with immunosuppression.\"","A second study from Qatar showed protection from the Pfizer vaccine peaked in the first month after vaccination and then began to wane.","\"These findings suggest that a large proportion of the vaccinated population could lose its protection against infection in the coming months, perhaps increasing the potential for new epidemic waves,\" the team wrote in a report published in the New England Journal of Medicine.","How can protection wane against mild or asymptomatic infection while staying strong against severe disease?","","Vaccine protection against Covid-19 wanes over time, especially for older people, CDC says","It's because the human immune system is complex.","Antibodies form the first line of defense, stopping a virus from getting into some cells in the body. This is the protection that starts to wear off after time.","But there's a second line of defense -- cell-based immunity. Cells called B cells and T cells can take longer to generate than antibodies, but they provide a longer-lived, broader defense against infection and are responsible for decreases in severe infections.","So while people may be susceptible to mild illness after they've been vaccinated, they're much less likely to get really sick, end up in the hospital or die.","\"But there's a lot of reasons people don't want to get sick. They don't want to pass it to loved ones. People don't want to pass it to young children that can't get vaccinated yet,\" Falsey said.","The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been saying for months that's why even fully vaccinated people need to continue taking precautions against infection -- wearing masks when around a lot of other people who may or may not be vaccinated, especially indoors, and making sure rooms are well ventilated.","","Do Americans need boosters yet? Here are the questions the FDA will be asking","The FDA is considering applications later this month from both Moderna and Johnson & Johnson to authorize booster doses of their vaccines. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has said he thinks a third dose of vaccine will become part of the standard regimen for Covid-19.","\"They just don't need to storm the pharmacies and panic.\"","The people getting boosters now should have been among the first to have been vaccinated -- in January, February and March. They include people 65 and older, adults with conditions putting them at risk of severe disease and people in occupations or living conditions that put them at higher than average risk of infection.","Everyone else should cool it for now.","","Johnson & Johnson asks FDA to authorize Covid-19 vaccine booster shots","\"They just don't need to storm the pharmacies and panic,\" Falsey said.","People should not go ahead and get booster doses if it hasn't been six months since their last dose of Pfizer vaccine, because they will not get the best immune response, Fauci said in a White House briefing last month.","\"There will be temptations, for example, for people who recently got vaccinated to not wait for the six month period of time,\" Fauci said. But waiting for several months after the initial immunization to boost helps produce a stronger response. Immune system cells that help restore waning immunity respond more robustly if they are allowed to go into a resting state after the first round of vaccination.","That said, most people should eventually plan on getting boosters, Falsey said.","\"Probably it's going to be true of any of the vaccines, not just Pfizer -- we'll benefit from boosting immunity. That's not the same thing as saying it's critically necessary,\" she said.","While people who have recovered from an infection have some protection, they're even more protected if they get vaccinated, too.","\"I think that, depending on your own natural immunity because you feel like you're a strong person is like playing Russian roulette,\" Falsey said.","Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter","Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.","","Even young, seemingly healthy people have become seriously ill from Covid-19 and have died from it.","\"I would never depend only on my natural immunity to weather this virus.

This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25.35% per year. These returns cover a period from January 1, 1988 through October 4, 2021. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.","","Visit Performance Disclosure for information about the performance numbers displayed above.","","Visit www.zacksdata.com to get our data and content for your mobile app or website.","","Real time prices by BATS.

The province assures that those who have not reported symptoms should feel confident they will not develop the rare side effect at a later date.","","A severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) and Bell’s palsy (facial paralysis) are also rare.","","Moore says that individuals aged 18 to 24 that received Moderna as their first dose can safely take Pfizer-BioNTech as their second shot, adding that mixing vaccines is safe and effective.","","Should residents wish to receive Moderna as their second shot and prefer to do so, the province says it can be authorized with informed consent.","","Moore says provincial health officials will continue to administer the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in youths aged 12 to 17, including those turning 12 in 2021.","","There are just under three million doses of the Pfizer vaccine readily available in Ontario. Moore says there is significant supply to ensure that the province moves ahead with the recommendation.","","Moore is assuring residents who received the first shot of Moderna that they “absolutely did the right thing” to protect themselves against the virus and the Delta variant.","","Health care providers must report possible reactions following vaccination to their local public health authority. The public health authority then reports them to the Public Health Agency of Canada.","","Provincial data says 86 per cent of people aged 12 and older have at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose, and 80 per cent have received both shots.","","Health Canada announced in mid-September that both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna’s mRNA vaccines were formally granted full approval for anyone aged 12-and-up in the country.","","Pfizer-BioNTech’s vaccine was initially authorized for use in Canada under an interim order on December 9, 2020.","","Comments","No comments have been left yet, get the conversation started!","Leave a Comment Below","Sign in to comment.","","All fields are required.","Comment","","Want to embed media into your comment?

They found a slightly increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis in males 18-24 after administration of the Moderna vaccine. Myocarditis is inflammation of the heart muscle and pericarditis is inflammation of the membrane around the heart.","","The risk is about one in 5,000 in males aged 18-24 who received Moderna, and symptoms typically occur within a week of the second dose, the province said.","","Ontario vaccine passport: How to access your COVID-19 immunization receipt and where it’s required","","Individuals who received Moderna as a first dose can safely take the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine as a second dose, the province said, noting that two mRNA doses offer the best protection against COVID-19, regardless of brand.","","Isaac Bogoch, an infectious diseases physician at Toronto’s University Health Network, said the decision to recommend the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine over Moderna’s is a smart move.","","“If you’ve got no issues with supply and if you’ve got a clear indicator that one vaccine has a lower incidence of a rare adverse effect than another one, then you should preferentially use that vaccine. It’s as simple as that,” Dr. Bogoch said.","","The vast majority of cases of heart inflammation linked to COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are mild and resolve with anti-inflammatory medication. A small number of individuals have been hospitalized as a result of heart inflammation after vaccination in Ontario and no deaths have been reported, according to the province. The rates are similar to what’s been reported in other countries.","","Anyone who received the Moderna vaccine should feel assured they did the right thing, the province said. If more than a week has passed since vaccination and no symptoms have appeared, it’s unlikely the individual will experience heart inflammation.","","Unvaccinated individuals face a much higher likelihood of developing heart inflammation as a result of COVID-19 infections, health officials said, and the risk of severe illness and other complications is also much greater.","","Our Morning Update and Evening Update newsletters are written by Globe editors, giving you a concise summary of the day’s most important headlines.

That means Pfizer is the preferred vaccine, but those who choose to can still received Moderna. Teens between 12 and 17 already receive just Pfizer doses.","","The decision is based on information from Ontario’s adverse events following immunization surveillance system about myocarditis, which is inflammation of the heart and pericarditis, inflammation of the lining of the heart.","","Ontario was responding to recent data from the province which found that between June 1 and Aug. 7, 2021, based on more than 96,000 doses, the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis for males between 18 and 24 following a second dose of Moderna was one in 5,000.

But the majority of cases observed in Ontario were mild and short-lived, usually treated with anti-inflammatory drugs and rest. A small number ended up in ICU, but usually for monitoring. There were no related deaths.","","The risk of myocarditis/pericarditis and other serious health issues from COVID-19 infection is higher.","","The issue has been observed in other countries and has become the focus of some anti-vax groups especially since a pre-print study from the University of Ottawa Heart Institute incorrectly calculated the risk of myocarditis as significantly higher than it is. The study has since been withdrawn, but not until it spread like wildfire through the anti-vaccine community.","","Advertisement","STORY CONTINUES BELOW","This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.","Article content","On Wednesday, Ontario’s Chief Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Kieran Moore, said he is aware that myocarditis has been a source of vaccine hesitancy among some and had concerns about addressing it.","","“But I have to build trust with the public and the public deserves to know the facts on the risk,” he said. “We have a robust adverse events surveillance system informed by eminent groups. All of those groups recommended that we inform the public of this increased risk of a very rare event.”","","Moore also said that two of his sons are between 20 and 23 and both received Moderna vaccines.","","“It is an excellent product that has a very good immune uptake and I have complete confidence in it, but we must be accountable and transparent. I hope the public sees that this is our means of building trust in the vaccine delivery system.”","","Advertisement","STORY CONTINUES BELOW","This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.","Article content","Earlier, Ontario and other provinces stopped offering AstraZeneca vaccines after studies showed an increased risk of rare blood clots.","","Provincial officials say symptoms related to myocarditis and pericarditis usually start within one week after vaccination, more commonly after a second dose.","","“Individuals who have not developed symptoms within this timeline should feel confident that they are unlikely to develop symptoms later,” a provincial briefing document read.","","The province also said those who received a first dose of the Moderna vaccine “absolutely did the right thing to protect themselves, their loved ones and communities.”","","Earlier, some of those administering vaccinations reported a preference for Pfizer over Moderna, something provincial and public health officials attempted to overcome.

Not only can youngsters sometimes get seriously ill, but keeping them in school can be a challenge with the coronavirus still raging in poorly vaccinated communities.","","Pfizer announced in a tweet that it had formally filed its application with the Food and Drug Administration.","","Now the FDA will have to decide if there’s enough evidence that the shots are safe and will work for younger children like they do for teens and adults. An independent expert panel will publicly debate the evidence on Oct. 26.","","One big change: Pfizer says its research shows the younger kids should get a third of the dose now given to everyone else. After their second dose, the 5- to 11-year-olds developed virus-fighting antibody levels just as strong as teens and young adults get from regular-strength shots.","","While kids are at lower risk of severe illness or death than older people, COVID-19 does sometimes kill children and cases in youngsters have skyrocketed as the extra-contagious delta variant has swept through the country","","“It makes me very happy that I am helping other kids get the vaccine,” said Sebastian Prybol, 8, of Raleigh, North Carolina. He is enrolled in Pfizer’s study at Duke University and doesn’t yet know if he received the vaccine or dummy shots.","","“We do want to make sure that it is absolutely safe for them,” said Sebastian’s mother, Britni Prybol. But she said she will be “overjoyed” if the FDA clears the vaccine.","","Pfizer studied the lower dose in 2,268 volunteers ages 5 to 11, and has said there were no serious side effects. The study isn’t large enough to detect any extremely rare side effects, such as the heart inflammation that sometimes occurs after the second dose of the regular-strength vaccine, mostly in young men.","","If the FDA authorizes emergency use of the kid-sized doses, there’s another hurdle before vaccinations in this age group can begin. Advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will decide whether to recommend the shots for youngsters, and the CDC will make a final decision.","","___","","AP journalist Emma Tobin contributed to this report.","","___","","The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

There’s a slightly increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis in males 18-24 after administration of the Moderna vaccine, the Canadian health authorities said, when recommending the Ontario adolescents vaccine, according to multiple reports. Pfizer-BioNTech shots shall be given over Moderna \"out of an abundance of caution,” as studies conducted between June and August have shown that the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis in young males was higher, one in nearly 5,000 vaccinations. But no cases of fatalities were reported. ","","\"I'm not holding any facts back, there is a risk,\" said Dr Kieran Moore, Ontario's chief medical officer of health was quoted as saying at the presser on Thursday, September 30. The risk of adverse event in those who received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was one in 28,000, he further informed. ","","While Canada is recommending young adults to receive the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine instead of Moderna, those willing to choose the latter shot can still go ahead, the Canadian health authorities stated.

This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25.35% per year. These returns cover a period from January 1, 1988 through October 4, 2021. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.","","Visit Performance Disclosure for information about the performance numbers displayed above.","","Visit www.zacksdata.com to get our data and content for your mobile app or website.","","Real time prices by BATS.

It is effective immediately.","","\"I know that this news may make some people nervous and heighten concerns about receiving the COVID vaccine and I can understand that, but the benefits of vaccination continue to significantly outweigh the risks of COVID-19 illness and related, possibly severe, consequences. Vaccines are safe, they are effective at protecting us and have significantly reduced the risk of infection, hospitalization and the use of the intensive care units in Ontario alone,\" said Dr. Kieran Moore, Ontario's chief medical officer of health.","","The change is out of an abundance of caution based on the current available analysis from Ontario's adverse events following immunization surveillance system.","","There has been an observed increase in the rare heart condition called pericarditis/myocarditis after vaccination for people who receive Moderna compared to Pfizer, particularly in men.","","Myocarditis is the inflammation of the heart muscle and pericarditis is inflammation of the lining around the heart.","","Between June 1 and Aug. 7, the risk of pericarditis/myocarditis in males aged 18 to 24 after receiving their second dose was one in 5,000, according to the government. ","","According to Public Health Ontario, during the enhanced surveillance period in Ontario from June 1 to Aug. 7:","","20.1 cases of myocarditis/pericarditis per million doses were reported in males ages 18 to 24 after their first dose of the Moderna vaccine, compared to 15.5 per million for the Pfizer vaccine.","198.6 cases of myocarditis/pericarditis per million doses were reported in males ages 18 to 24 after their second dose of Moderna, compared to 35.5 per million for the Pfizer vaccine.","0 cases of myocarditis/pericarditis per million doses were reported in females ages 18 to 24 after their first dose of the Moderna vaccine, compared to 18.7 per million for the Pfizer vaccine.","59.6 cases of myocarditis/pericarditis per million doses were reported in females ages 18 to 24 after their second dose of Moderna, compared to 39.9 per million for the Pfizer vaccine.","Symptoms typically started within a week after vaccination, typically after the second dose. The majority of cases have been mild. People have recovered quickly with anti-inflammatory medication such as ibuprofen. There have been no deaths to date.","","Typical symptoms include chest pain, shortness of breath, irregular heartbeat and fatigue.","","People in the affected age bracket who received Moderna for their first dose can take Pfizer for their second dose. If someone wants to receive Moderna for the second dose, they can do so with informed consent. ","","Pfizer will continue to be used for youth ages 12 to 17.","","Moore anticipates in the next couple of weeks Health Canada will review the effectiveness and safety of the Pfizer vaccine in kids ages five to 11 years.","","It’s a pediatric dose, which is a third of what the adult dose is.","","“The risk of myocarditis/pericarditis from the specialists that I’ve spoken to — it typically increases after puberty. So we don’t anticipate that the five to 11 will have a high risk for that very rare side effect,” he said.","","","See a typo/mistake?","Have a story/tip?","This has not been shared.

Unvaccinated donors could also pass COVID-19 to the recipient even if they initially test negative for the disease, he said.","","“Studies have found transplant patients who contract COVID-19 may have a mortality rate of 20 per cent or higher,” he said.","","It’s not clear how common this type of policy is.","","The American Hospital Association, which represents nearly 5,000 hospitals, health care systems and networks in the United States, said it did not have data to share on the issue. But it said many transplant programs insist that patients get vaccinated for COVID-19 because of the weakened state of their immune system.","","While any type of surgery may stress a patient’s immune system and leave them vulnerable to contracting COVID-19 later, organ transplants recipients are even more at risk because they have to take a powerful regime of drugs to suppress their immune system to keep their body from rejecting the new organ, which is seen by the body as a foreign object, Nancy Foster, AHA’s vice president for quality and patient safety policy said in a statement.","","“Further, if patients were to wait to get their vaccine until after the surgery, it is unlikely that their immune system could mount the desired antibody reaction given that they are taking anti-rejection medications,” she said.","","Transplant centres in Washington, Vermont, Massachusetts and Alabama have polices requiring that recipients be vaccinated, according to news reports.","","Cleveland Clinic recently decided to require COVID-19 vaccinations for both transplant recipients and living donors, the organization said in a statement.","","Some health care systems recommend or strongly encourage vaccination for transplants, including the Mayo Clinic and Sentara Healthcare, two of the nation’s largest. The University of Alabama Birmingham’s School of Medicine transplant program only recommends that living donors receive a vaccine, but it does not require it for the donation process.","","The best time to get a COVID-19 vaccine is before an organ transplant. If time allows, patients should get their second dose of the available vaccines at least a couple of weeks prior to transplant “so that your body has a good immune response to the vaccine,” said Dr. Deepali Kumar, the American Society of Transplantation’s president-elect and an infectious disease physician.","","Many major religious denominations have no objections to the COVID-19 vaccines. But the rollout has prompted heated debates because of the long-time role that cell lines derived from fetal tissue have played a role, directly or indirectly, in the research and development of various vaccines and medicines.","","Roman Catholic leaders in New Orleans and St. Louis went so far as to call Johnson & Johnson’s COVID-19 shot “morally compromised.” J&J has stressed that there is no fetal tissue in its vaccine.","","Moreover, the Vatican’s doctrine office has said it is “morally acceptable” for Catholics to receive COVID-19 vaccines that are based on research that used cells derived from aborted fetuses. Pope Francis himself has said it would be “suicide” not to get the shot, and he has been fully vaccinated with the Pfizer formula.","","Ethical considerations should take both individual and societal perspectives into account, Dr. Kumar said.","","“It’s really what’s best for the patient at this time and from a societal perspective as well,” she said. “The more patients that get vaccinated, you know, we have better outcomes.”","","To Lutali, a recruiter for tech companies, it seems like her hospital was so insistent on saving her from COVID-19 that it is willing to let her possibly die by blocking her transplant surgery.","","Lutali, who does not belong to a denomination, said she does not live in fear of dying because of her belief in the afterlife. She is searching for another hospital, possibly in Texas or Florida, where she could get a transplant without being vaccinated.","","“I have hope that something will come along that is something I can live with in terms of my choices,” she said.","","Our Morning Update and Evening Update newsletters are written by Globe editors, giving you a concise summary of the day’s most important headlines.

Authorizes Moderna and Johnson & Johnson Booster Shots","The agency will also allow vaccine recipients to pick which vaccine they want as a booster, endorsing a mix-and-match approach.","","","","","A medical worker administering a Moderna vaccine in Seattle in May.Credit...Ruth Fremson/The New York Times","","By Noah Weiland and Sharon LaFraniere","Oct. 20, 2021","WASHINGTON — The Food and Drug Administration authorized booster shots on Wednesday for tens of millions of recipients of Moderna’s two-dose coronavirus vaccine and Johnson & Johnson’s single-dose shot, significantly expanding efforts to bolster protection for vulnerable Americans.","","The agency also authorized medical providers to give people a booster shot of a different Covid-19 vaccine, a strategy known as “mix and match.”","","That decision may dampen interest in the United States in Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine, which studies have found provides less protection than the other two. Recipients of that vaccine will have the option of seeking a Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech booster, which could prompt a more substantial jump in protective antibodies. Recipients of the other two vaccines will have the same leeway to choose a different vaccine for a booster shot.","","The regulators, who authorized boosters for high-risk recipients of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine last month, did not recommend any one vaccine over another as a booster.","","ADVERTISEMENT","","Continue reading the main story","“We do not have preferential recommendations,” Dr. Janet Woodcock, the F.D.A.’s acting commissioner, said at an evening news briefing. “We feel that if patients have questions, they should consult with perhaps their physician or another provider.”","","The latest authorizations arrived amid what is shaping up to be a busy stretch of major regulatory decisions on vaccines. The F.D.A. is expected to decide in the coming weeks whether Pfizer-BioNTech’s vaccine should be authorized for children 5 to 11. The agency’s independent vaccine advisory committee is set to consider the matter on Tuesday and make a recommendation.","","Regulators may also decide as early as November whether to allow even more people to obtain booster shots, including younger adult recipients of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines who are not yet eligible. While many vaccine experts have questioned whether healthy younger people need booster shots at this time, some members of the advisory committee urged the agency last week to expand eligibility.","","Dr. Peter Marks, the F.D.A.’s top vaccine regulator, said the agency could be “nimble” in including more younger adults. “It is something that can happen as soon as we see and feel that we need to take that action,” he said.","","One key question before regulators was whether to authorize a full or a half-dose of Moderna’s vaccine as a booster shot. Data from a federally funded study suggested a full-strength dose of Moderna could hugely boost the antibody levels of Johnson & Johnson recipients and increase the antibody levels of Pfizer recipients better than an additional shot of the same vaccine.","","ADVERTISEMENT","","Continue reading the main story","But Moderna only sought permission for a half-dose as a booster shot, submitting data in support of that. In the end, the F.D.A. decided to authorize the half-dose Moderna booster for recipients of all three vaccines, at least in part, Dr. Marks suggested, in order to limit confusion among providers.","","The move on Wednesday to make a much larger swath of Americans eligible for boosters followed unanimous votes last week from the F.D.A.’s advisory committee to recommend the authorizations. A separate committee advising the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is scheduled to vote on Thursday on its own recommendations for the Moderna and Johnson & Johnson boosters.","","The panel will also consider whether people need more guidance about when and whether to switch vaccines for a booster shot. C.D.C. officials are expected to argue for flexibility.","","Given the existing data, “we have to be noncommittal about what is the best,” Dr. Marks said. “We have to simply say that any one of these combinations is reasonable.”","","The C.D.C.’s director typically endorses that panel’s recommendations as a final step before vaccines are put into use. If the agency agrees with the F.D.A., those booster shots could be available to the public as soon as this weekend.","","The Coronavirus Pandemic: Latest Updates","Updated ","Oct. 27, 2021, 1:07 p.m. ET4 hours ago","4 hours ago","Pregnant and breastfeeding women are slower to respond to vaccination, researchers report.","Unequal vaccine access is widening the global economic gap, a U.N. agency says.","For long Covid patients, getting disability benefits can be a struggle.","The eligibility requirements for a booster differ depending on vaccine. Pfizer and Moderna recipients will be able to get an extra shot six months after their second injection if they are at least 65 years old or at high risk of severe Covid-19 complications because of medical conditions or where they work. Johnson & Johnson recipients — all of whom are 18 and older — will be eligible for a second shot at least two months after the first.","","The decision to allow recipients to switch to a different vaccine as a booster adds yet another layer of complexity. “Although it is not simple,” Dr. Marks said, “it’s not utterly hopelessly complex.”","","ADVERTISEMENT","","Continue reading the main story","Even as the F.D.A.’s advisory panel last week unanimously supported Moderna and Johnson & Johnson boosters last week, its experts raised concerns that the data in the companies’ applications was limited and, in the case of Johnson & Johnson’s, not independently verified.","","Moderna argued to the committee that a third shot of its vaccine would bolster protection against infection and more moderate disease. There appeared to be little evidence that the vaccine’s robust protection had waned significantly.","","In contrast, some F.D.A. experts and committee members argued that Johnson & Johnson recipients needed an additional shot to better bolster them against severe Covid-19, since that vaccine was less effective than those of Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech.","","The F.D.A. discussed data with the committee showing that Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine was only roughly 70 percent effective against hospitalization, compared with around 90 percent for Moderna and Pfizer.","","But other data, including from a study of nearly nine million people in New York State, found better results from a single dose of Johnson & Johnson, including for older Americans, with durable protection.","","What to Know About Covid-19 Booster Shots","","Who is eligible for a booster shot?","The F.D.A. has authorized booster shots for millions of recipients of the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines. Pfizer and Moderna recipients who are eligible for a booster include people 65 and older, and younger adults at high risk of severe Covid-19 because of medical conditions or where they work. Eligible Pfizer and Moderna recipients can get a booster at least six months after their second dose. All Johnson & Johnson recipients will be eligible for a second shot at least two months after the first.","","","Can I switch Covid vaccines for a booster?","","","What underlying medical conditions qualify for a booster shot?","","","What occupations are eligible for boosters?","","","Can I get a flu shot at the same time as a Covid vaccine or booster shot?","","The experts appeared swayed by the idea that a single shot of Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine never offered as much protection as the vaccines made by Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech, and thus needed to be shored up. They also argued that Moderna recipients should be eligible for booster shots, at least partly because Pfizer recipients already were. Pfizer won authorization for a booster shot last month, after it argued that the potency of its vaccine had waned against severe disease.","","ADVERTISEMENT","","Continue reading the main story","“We’ve already approved it for Pfizer, and I don’t see how we can possibly not approve it for Moderna” without sowing confusion, said Dr. Stanley Perlman, an infectious disease expert at the University of Iowa and an F.D.A. committee member.","","","Image","","The Food and Drug Administration’s decision to make recipients of the Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines eligible for booster shots followed unanimous votes in favor of authorization by its advisory committee. Credit...Bess Adler for The New York Times","Norman W. Baylor, the former director of the F.D.A.’s vaccines office, said that the lack of substantiated data for Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine was highly unusual, calling into question why the F.D.A. had pushed to gather its expert committee for a vote on booster shots.","","“It’s obvious F.D.A. was not as prepared,” he said. “The F.D.A. appears to be, from what we’ve seen, rushed to make a decision on these boosters.”","","After the Biden administration began pushing for a broad booster rollout in August, top officials said that streamlining booster recommendations could help avert public confusion. Dr. Marks has said the goal was to reach a “harmonized” approach toward booster recommendations for the general population.","","For at least some of the roughly 15 million people who chose the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, the debate over the company’s data may not matter. The F.D.A.’s decision to allow flexibility to providers and patients in booster shots could lead many of them to choose a Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech booster instead.","","Regulators were influenced by preliminary data from a federally funded study that measured antibody levels in people who received a different vaccine as a booster, comparing nine groups of 50 volunteers each. Those getting another dose of Johnson & Johnson saw antibodies go up just fourfold, the study found. Switching to a Pfizer-BioNTech booster raised antibody levels by a factor of 35. A full-dose Moderna booster raised them 76-fold.","","Dr. Kirsten E. Lyke of the University of Maryland School of Medicine, who presented the findings at the F.D.A. meeting last week, cautioned in an interview against drawing hasty conclusions from their results. By next month, the researchers hope to know how well the different boosters increase virus-attacking T cells. It is possible that Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine could do well in those results, she said, adding, “We’ll get a more rounded picture.”","","ADVERTISEMENT","","Continue reading the main story","Since the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was authorized as a booster shot last month, some state health officials have clamored for mix-and-match flexibility, saying it would help them reach older and at-risk residents in cases where they did not have a supply of the same vaccine that people initially received.","","Top C.D.C. officials suggested last week that the mix-and-match rules would also leave room for those concerned about side effects — for example, younger women worried about the Johnson & Johnson vaccine’s ties to a rare blood clotting condition — to switch brands. Some may be interested in switching to Johnson & Johnson, on the other hand, if they have concerns about rare heart-related side effects linked to the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines.","","“We would expect many people will continue to get the same series that they had already received,” Dr. Woodcock said. But she added: “We wanted to provide a lot of flexibility.”","","Carl Zimmer contributed reporting from New Haven, Conn.","","ADVERTISEMENT","","Continue reading the main story","Site Information Navigation","© 2021 The New York Times Company","NYTCoContact UsAccessibilityWork with usAdvertiseT Brand StudioYour Ad ChoicesPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapHelpSubscriptions","Already have an account?

The Zacks analyst believes that Pfizer looks well positioned to deliver several potential new breakthrough innovative medicines in the next five years, which can drive long-term growth.","","The Consumer Healthcare JV with Glaxo and merger of Upjohn unit with Mylan has made Pfizer a smaller company with a diversified portfolio of innovative drugs and vaccines.

The Zacks analyst believes that the company is likely to benefit from increased investment by wireless carriers in 4G LTE and 5G networks.","","Solid business fundamentals, prudent capital-allocation strategy as well as steady dividend payouts are encouraging. American Tower is rapidly expanding in the international markets, especially in the emerging Asian and Latin American markets. Tower operations in such markets, however, are not as profitable as that in the mature U.S. market.

Strong segmental performance was also witnessed during the quarter.

The Pfizer vaccine isn’t approved by the Food and Drug Administration for children under the age of 12.","","“Walgreens called me to say there was a mix-up, we did not receive the flu shot,” Alexandra Price told the local news outlet. “And I’m like well what did we get? And he was like we got the COVID-19 shot … And instantly I was like, ‘Well what does this mean for my kids?'”","","A lawyer for the family, Daniel Tuley, told the outlet that both children were taken to a pediatric cardiologist. The family was told that both kids were showing signs of heart trouble.","","“The children have experienced a number of adverse effects since receiving the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Fever, body aches, cough, headaches, and nausea are among the symptoms the children are experiencing,” Tuley said in a statement to news outlets. “The 4- and 5-year-old are also under treatment of a pediatric cardiologist for tachycardia and elevated blood pressure, respectively.”","","The family said the younger child became sick with a fever and a cough and the older child developed a fever.","","“Lukas started feeling sick before we even got home from Walgreens,” Price said, referring to her son, CNN reported.","","On Tuesday after a follow-up appointment, Alexandra said her son’s condition had improved but her daughter’s condition is worsening.","","“Her blood pressure is in the 98th percentile and she continues to have no energy,” Price said, referring to her daughter Sophia.","","Walgreens issued statements to several news outlets about the incident, describing such mix-ups as uncommon.","","“Generally speaking, such instances are rare, and Walgreens takes these matters very seriously,” Walgreens said in a statement. “In the event of any error, our first concern is always our patients’ well-being.”","","The pharmacy chain also said, “Our multi-step vaccination procedure includes several safety checks to minimize the chance of human error and we have reviewed this process with our pharmacy staff in order to prevent such occurrences.”","","Walgreens did not elaborate on how the mix-up could have occurred. The Epoch Times has contacted both Walgreens and Pfizer for comment.","","In September, a Walgreens in Fresno, California, also mistakenly injected a COVID-19 vaccine instead of a flu shot.",""," ","Jack Phillips","BREAKING NEWS REPORTER","Follow","Jack Phillips is a breaking news reporter at The Epoch Times based in New York.","TOP NEWS","","CHINA HUMAN RIGHTS","Refugee Recounts Perils of Free Speech Inside China","0","","CONGRESS","Hill GOPers Push Vaccine Exemptions as Mandate Protests Mount","0","","MILITARY","‘Poison Frogs’: US Urged to Make Taiwan Islands Too ‘Painful’ for China to Seize in Response to Wargame Results","0","","HEALTH NEWS","Respiratory Therapist Credits Spiritual Discipline With Remaining COVID-19 Free","1","","IMMIGRATION & BORDER SECURITY","Americans Stranded in Bulgaria Due to Biden’s Vaccine Mandate for Children Legally Immigrating","12","","US-CHINA RELATIONS","China’s 5G Activity Remains Active and Dangerous, Experts Warn","1","","Copyright © 2000 - 2021"],"https://techncruncher.blogspot.com/2021/10/nordic-countries-are-restricting-use-of.html":["Blog has been removed","Sorry, the blog at techncruncher.blogspot.com has been removed.

The company submitted data on a booster shot that is half the size of the doses used to give first and second shots of the vaccine so far.","Oct 6, 2021 10:31 AM By: Canadian Press","Updated Oct 6, 2021 10:35 AM","Share via Text Message","","OTTAWA — U.S. drugmaker Moderna is asking Health Canada to authorize a booster shot of its COVID-19 vaccine.","","The company submitted data on a booster shot that is half the size of the doses used to give first and second shots of the vaccine so far.","","Last month Moderna said there were signs immunity was waning the longer people got from their doses.","","Public health and vaccine experts in Canada are leery of recommending booster shots for most Canadians because the vaccines thus far are showing to maintain strong protection against severe disease even if protection against infection at all is dropping.","","The National Advisory Committee on Immunization said in late September a third dose of vaccine was warranted for people in long-term care homes or with compromised immune systems, similar to recommendations made by both the European Medicines Agency and the United States Food and Drug Administration.","","NACI says many seniors and immune-compromised patients don't mount as robust a response after two doses as younger or healthier people do, and many also didn't benefit from a longer interval between doses.","","NACI says evidence has shown stronger immunity in people who waited more than three or four weeks to get their second dose. Canada delayed second doses for millions of people because of a short supply of vaccine in the winter and spring, but by the time that decision was made most long-term care residents had already been fully vaccinated.","","Health Canada says it received the application from Moderna and in a tweet said it is \"conducting a thorough, independent and evidence-based review of the submission.\"","","Booster shots have also been controversial because of the inequitable distribution of vaccines between wealthy and poorer countries. Millions of people globally haven't been able to access even one dose of vaccine, and the World Health Organization has asked countries to limit booster shots so other countries can access the vaccines as well.","","The Our World in Data project says as of Oct. 1, about 30 million booster shots have been given out worldwide, in at least 16 countries including 11 million doses in Turkey, 4.4 million in the United States and about 3.5 million in both Israel and Chile.","","This report by The Canadian Press was first published Oct. 6, 2021.","","Mia Rabson, The Canadian Press","","This has been shared 0 times","Share via Text Message","How did this story make you feel?view results >","","Happy"," ","Amused"," ","Afraid"," ","Don't Care"," ","Sad"," ","Frustrated"," ","Angry","Is Bradford's local news important to you?","If it is, we could use your help.

It was authorized for people at least 16 years old last December, and for kids between 12 and 15 in May.","","The pediatric data on kids between five and 11 showed a safe and strong immune response from two doses, which are one-third the size given to teens and adults.","","More than 80 per cent of Canadians over 12 are now fully vaccinated against COVID-19, and as vaccines help slow infections in teens and adults, the infection rate among kids has climbed.","","Some Canadian pharmacists don’t think there is a good reason why Canada should risk delaying getting doses into arms by waiting for Pfizer to deliver more vials specifically for kids, when pharmacies and public health clinics can easily just use the same syringes to draw the smaller doses of the vaccine.","","Pfizer has delivered more than 46 million doses to Canada to date, and an analysis of the available data on administration from provincial and federal governments suggests there are more than enough Pfizer doses already in Canada to vaccinate kids between five and 11 years old.","","But that’s not what Pfizer is requesting in its submission to Health Canada.","","“The rollout of new formulations, including doses of our vaccine for this age group, has been incorporated into the supply agreement that Pfizer and BioNTech have with the Government of Canada,” Antoniou said.","","“A delivery schedule for the pediatric formulation will be determined shortly after regulatory approval is granted with the intent of bringing doses to Canada as quickly as possible.”","","Canada signed a new contract with Pfizer for pediatric doses last spring.","","Waiting for new deliveries will delay vaccinations, and pharmacists could vaccinate the day after it gets approved if they can use the vials they already have. The existing vials hold six adult-sized doses, but would hold three times as many doses for kids.","","One concern may be contamination if a vial is accessed 18 times instead of six, but that can be mitigated with adapters.","","Mia Rabson, The Canadian Press","","PreviousAutumn and Thanksgiving as seen through your eyesNextPolar Bear to become an official Manitoba emblem","More Local News","","Friesen thrilled to officiate at WHL Cup in Red Deer, Alberta","Taylor Friesen has become one of the most respected referees in the province and with that, he's earned the right to officiate at the WHL Cup in Red Deer, Alberta. \"Hockey Manitoba has a lot of…","","Manitoba expands third dose recommendations","Manitoba is expanding its recommendations for third doses of the COVID-19 vaccine.

But we also understand that investors develop their own strategies, so we are constantly looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong companies for our readers.Considering these trends, value investing is clearly one of the most preferred ways to find strong stocks in any type of market. Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large.Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the \"Value\" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, \"A\" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.Pfizer (PFE - Free Report) is a stock many investors are watching right now. PFE is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and an A for Value. The stock is trading with P/E ratio of 11.93 right now. For comparison, its industry sports an average P/E of 14.19. PFE's Forward P/E has been as high as 14.02 and as low as 10.19, with a median of 11.77, all within the past year.","We should also highlight that PFE has a P/B ratio of 3.43. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This company's current P/B looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/B of 5.49. Over the past year, PFE's P/B has been as high as 4.01 and as low as 2.91, with a median of 3.17.Finally, our model also underscores that PFE has a P/CF ratio of 13.52. This metric focuses on a firm's operating cash flow and is often used to find stocks that are undervalued based on the strength of their cash outlook. PFE's current P/CF looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 19.09. Over the past 52 weeks, PFE's P/CF has been as high as 17.35 and as low as 10.33, with a median of 14.16.These are just a handful of the figures considered in Pfizer's great Value grade. Still, they help show that the stock is likely being undervalued at the moment. Add this to the strength of its earnings outlook, and we can clearly see that PFE is an impressive value stock right now.","In-Depth Zacks Research for the Tickers Above","","Normally $25 each - click below to receive one report FREE:","","Pfizer Inc.

As a gastroenterologist treating hospitalized Covid patients, it brought back a flood of difficult memories from the past year. Among the most haunting were the pregnant people with severe liver injury I cared for in the intensive care unit who couldn’t see their newborns.","","Two months later, I became pregnant myself.","","The pandemic has transformed pregnancy, an already stressful life event, into a unique minefield. Pregnant people faced early bans on hospital visitors during labor, exclusion from the original vaccination studies and disproportionate devastation from the Delta variant, which in August cost 22 lives — the highest number of Covid-19 deaths in a single month among pregnant people since the pandemic started.","","Since January 2020, at least 180 pregnant people have died from Covid-19. The recent pleas from federal health officials for all pregnant people to get vaccinated as soon as possible has provided the kind of no-nonsense clarity that expecting parents might have been waiting for. But what does that mean for boosters?","","The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lists pregnancy as a medical condition that would make someone eligible for a Covid-19 booster. Official guidelines firmly declare that you “should” get a booster if you meet certain criteria — for instance if you work in a high-exposure field, like as a nurse or teacher (both professions that incidentally make up the two most common occupations for pregnant workers in the United States). But the guidelines recommend that people who fall into other high risk categories, including those who are pregnant, weigh the individual risks and benefits of the booster.","","This can leave many pregnant people like myself wondering if they should rush to get a third shot. Dr. Dana Meaney-Delman, the lead scientist for maternal Covid-19 immunization at the C.D.C., has been considering these questions carefully. “There’s nothing to suggest boosters are a safety issue. We have great confidence in these vaccines,” she said, adding that anyone who is pregnant, postpartum, considering pregnancy or who might be pregnant in the future should get the vaccine. “That’s the most urgent message,” she said.","","She noted that, as an OB-GYN herself, she encourages a third dose for her pregnant patients. “From a biological plausibility perspective, there’s really no reason not to recommend a booster,” she said.","","The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, as well as the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, also did not mince words in the advisories they updated on Oct. 1: Yes, pregnant people who completed the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine series at least six months ago should get the booster shot. (Other vaccines will likely soon be authorized as boosters.)","","Their recommendations underscore the risks of severe consequences from Covid-19 during pregnancy, as well as evidence of waning immunity.","","Many experts suggest that pregnant people are not so much immunocompromised, as once believed, but that their immune systems change in unique ways during each stage of pregnancy, opening windows of vulnerability to Covid-19. Besides these changes, the physical demands of pregnancy — the growing fetus’ strain on the diaphragm and lungs, the increased strain on the cardiovascular system — put pregnant people at higher risk of being hospitalized and dying from Covid-19 without the vaccine.","","Signing up for a booster shot might also help the unborn baby. Dr. Andrea Edlow, an OB-GYN and researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital, demonstrated that the immune response induced by Covid-19 mRNA vaccines in pregnant and lactating women was far greater than the response produced by a coronavirus infection. They also found that those antibodies were robustly passed to the fetus through the placenta, as well as through breast milk.","","The Coronavirus Pandemic: Latest Updates","Updated ","Oct. 27, 2021, 1:07 p.m. ET4 hours ago","4 hours ago","Pregnant and breastfeeding women are slower to respond to vaccination, researchers report.","Unequal vaccine access is widening the global economic gap, a U.N. agency says.","For long Covid patients, getting disability benefits can be a struggle.","Although countries like Israel and most recently the United States have started giving booster shots to pregnant people, experts are still collecting data on their outcomes. It might be months, or more, before we have more information.","","Nonetheless, there is no reason to expect that the booster side effects in pregnant people will be different than those in the general population, according to Dr. Meaney-Delman, who led a C.D.C. study on vaccinations in pregnancy.","","The study, which analyzed the self-reported side effects from more than 35,000 pregnant people, demonstrated that vaccine reactions were similar among pregnant women compared with nonpregnant women. Among the most common were pain at the injection site and fatigue.","","What to Know About Covid-19 Booster Shots","","Who is eligible for a booster shot?","The F.D.A. has authorized booster shots for millions of recipients of the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines. Pfizer and Moderna recipients who are eligible for a booster include people 65 and older, and younger adults at high risk of severe Covid-19 because of medical conditions or where they work. Eligible Pfizer and Moderna recipients can get a booster at least six months after their second dose. All Johnson & Johnson recipients will be eligible for a second shot at least two months after the first.","","","Can I switch Covid vaccines for a booster?","","","What underlying medical conditions qualify for a booster shot?","","","What occupations are eligible for boosters?","","","Can I get a flu shot at the same time as a Covid vaccine or booster shot?","","Regarding timing, the sooner you get a booster during your pregnancy, the better, Dr. Edlow said. Not only does an earlier booster likely mean a lower chance of a breakthrough infection (which could increase the risk of preterm birth), but, as is the case with other recommended vaccines in pregnancy, an earlier shot could translate to more antibodies passed to the fetus.","","Waiting until just before delivery means you will have lower antibody levels, “and you don’t have as much time for the antibodies to transfer across the cord, so it’s just less effective,” Dr. Edlow said. “You’re going to give your baby the best protection if you do it earlier.”","","Another reason eligible pregnant people shouldn’t wait to get a booster is that the types of antibodies that pass through the umbilical cord are different from those that pass through breast milk. The blood-borne antibodies that cross the umbilical cord are much longer lasting than those primarily passed through breast milk, Dr. Edlow said. By getting the booster during pregnancy, the baby gets the benefit of both.","","In the end, I decided to receive the booster shot two weeks ago at 33 weeks pregnant. I had some fatigue (and took a nap in the evening) as well as muscle aches the next day. By the following morning, I felt completely back to normal.","","“You shouldn’t think, ‘I need to get boosted or I’m going to die from Covid.’ That’s the rationale for the first vaccine doses,” Dr. Edlow said. The booster, however, can prevent pregnant people from symptomatic illness or from transferring the virus to young children at home in addition to providing protection to their newborns.","","“I don’t think there are any special considerations. I think they should just go get the booster,” she said.","","Dr. Trisha Pasricha is a writer and physician at Massachusetts General Hospital.

The extra shots have already been authorized for Pfizer-BioNTech recipients.","","Johnson & Johnson says that a second dose of its shot boosts the levels of antibodies against the coronavirus and is more effective at preventing Covid-19.  ","","“We want to provide optimal protection against Covid,” Dr. Penny Heaton, global therapeutic area head for vaccines at Johnson & Johnson, said at Friday’s meeting.","","But F.D.A. staff have expressed doubts about the quality of the research. And a booster dose of one of the mRNA vaccines, either the Pfizer or Moderna shot, may offer even greater protection, preliminary data suggest.","","Here are answers to some common questions.","","Why didn’t officials recommend boosters for people who got the Johnson & Johnson vaccine sooner?","All of the vaccines authorized in the United States provide strong protection against severe disease and death from Covid-19.","","Over the summer, experts grew concerned that mRNA vaccines were losing some of their effectiveness against infection, although their effectiveness against hospitalization was largely unchanged. Last month, the F.D.A. authorized a booster of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for certain populations at high risk from Covid-19; an advisory recommended a booster shot of Moderna’s vaccine on Thursday for the same populations.","","Unlike Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine uses a modified adenovirus to deliver its instructions to human cells, and that difference is reflected in how the vaccines are now performing.  The Johnson & Johnson vaccine started out with a lower efficacy than the mRNA vaccines, but it has not shown much change in its effectiveness over time. Likewise, studies of antibody levels have found little change over eight months.","","Data on the Johnson & Johnson vaccine has been slower in coming, in part because vaccine was not authorized until the end of February, two months after the mRNA vaccines. In addition, Johnson & Johnson vaccinations were temporarily paused while health officials investigated reports that a very small number of people had developed a rare blood-clotting condition after receiving the vaccine.","","Video","","Back","","0:00/1:33","TRANSCRIPT","","White House Outlines Plan for Coronavirus Booster Shots","Vivek Murthy, the U.S. surgeon general, said on Aug. 18 that the White House coronavirus response team planned to begin offering booster shots of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines in September, pending F.D.A. approval.","Having reviewed the most current data, it is now our clinical judgment that the time to lay out a plan for Covid-19 boosters is now. Recent data makes clear that protection against mild and moderate disease has decreased over time. This is likely due to both waning immunity and the strength of the widespread Delta variant. Even though this new data, even though this new data affirms that vaccine protection remains high against the worst outcomes of Covid, we are concerned that this pattern of decline we are seeing will continue in the months ahead, which could lead to reduced protection against severe disease, hospitalization and death. That is why today we are announcing our plan to stay ahead of this virus by being prepared to offer Covid-19 booster shots to fully vaccinated adults 18 years and older. They would be eligible for their booster shot eight months after receiving their second dose of the Pfizer or Moderna mRNA vaccines. We plan to start this program the week of Sept. 20, 2021. This plan is pending the F.D.A. conducting an independent evaluation of the safety and effectiveness of a third dose of the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines, and the C.D.C.’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices is issuing a booster dose recommendations based on a thorough review of the evidence.","","","Vivek Murthy, the U.S. surgeon general, said on Aug. 18 that the White House coronavirus response team planned to begin offering booster shots of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines in September, pending F.D.A. approval.CreditCredit...Kevin Mohatt for The New York Times","How effective is a single dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine?","The company’s clinical trials, conducted before the Delta variant was widespread, found that the Johnson & Johnson vaccine had 72 percent efficacy overall in the United States, lower than the roughly 95 percent efficacy of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. The vaccine’s protection against severe or critical disease was higher, at 85 percent worldwide.","","However, it is hard to make direct comparisons between the vaccines, which were tested in different locations and at different times.","","All of the available vaccines appear to lose some effectiveness against Delta, which may be able to dodge some of the immune system’s antibodies. But data suggests that the Johnson & Johnson vaccine holds up well against the variant.","","Preliminary results from clinical trials of nearly 500,000 health care workers in South Africa suggested that a single dose of the vaccine had efficacy of up to 96 percent against death and 71 percent against hospitalization from infections caused by Delta.","","It was “a very large analysis and very clear results showing that the single-shot J.&J. vaccine provided substantial protection against the Delta variant,” Dr. Dan Barouch, a virologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, said in August. Dr. Barouch has conducted studies for Johnson & Johnson but was not involved in the South Africa trial.","","The company also announced results from another real-world study, conducted in the United States, last month. The study, which has not yet been reviewed by experts, found that the vaccine’s effectiveness remained stable at 79 percent through July, suggesting that it continued to provide good protection against Delta. It was 81 percent effective at preventing hospitalizations.","","The Coronavirus Pandemic: Latest Updates","Updated ","Oct. 27, 2021, 1:07 p.m. ET","Pregnant and breastfeeding women are slower to respond to vaccination, researchers report.","Unequal vaccine access is widening the global economic gap, a U.N. agency says.","For long Covid patients, getting disability benefits can be a struggle.","“These vaccines are working,” said John Moore, a virologist at Weill Cornell Medicine.","","What do we know about the benefits of a second dose?","Recently, Johnson & Johnson carried out studies that it claims show that a booster shot of its vaccine will help protect people against Covid-19. It will raise the effectiveness of the vaccine overall, the company argues, and be especially useful against new variants. But regulators have been critical of the company’s data.","","Last month, the company announced the results of a clinical trial that found that two doses of the vaccine, given two months apart, have 94 percent efficacy in the United States against mild to severe disease, compared with 74 percent efficacy after a single shot.","","Globally, however, the results were less convincing. Worldwide, the efficacy of a second dose of the vaccine was 74 percent, up from 66 percent after one shot. And the statistical uncertainties around those estimates make it hard to determine just how much better two doses are than one.","","On the other hand, it appears that a second dose does improve protection against severe disease, with an estimated efficacy of 100 percent.","","Regulators have criticized the study’s short follow-up period.","","Image","Some people who have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine have sought mRNA boosters on their own. But experts say if the government recommends a booster, it would be for a second dose of the same vaccine.Credit...Bryan Anselm for The New York Times","Why didn’t they recommend an mRNA booster instead of another Johnson & Johnson shot?","The F.D.A. panel voted only on whether to recommend a second Johnson & Johnson shot on Friday.","","But some scientists have suggested that mixing and matching vaccines may provide better protection than getting two doses of the same shot. And preliminary data from a study conducted by the National Institutes of Health suggests that the approach has promise. The study, which has not yet been reviewed by experts, involved nine different groups of participants, of roughly 50 people each.","","Each group received a different vaccine and booster combination; some people received a booster dose of the same brand as the original vaccine, while others switched to a different brand for their booster.","","Researchers found that Johnson & Johnson recipients who received a Moderna booster experienced a 76-fold increase in their antibody levels, compared with a fourfold increase after a second Johnson & Johnson dose. A Pfizer booster prompted a 35-fold increase in antibodies.","","What to Know About Covid-19 Booster Shots","","Who is eligible for a booster shot?","The F.D.A. has authorized booster shots for millions of recipients of the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines. Pfizer and Moderna recipients who are eligible for a booster include people 65 and older, and younger adults at high risk of severe Covid-19 because of medical conditions or where they work. Eligible Pfizer and Moderna recipients can get a booster at least six months after their second dose. All Johnson & Johnson recipients will be eligible for a second shot at least two months after the first.","","","Can I switch Covid vaccines for a booster?","","","What underlying medical conditions qualify for a booster shot?","","","What occupations are eligible for boosters?","","","Can I get a flu shot at the same time as a Covid vaccine or booster shot?","","“To me that data looked pretty solid,” said Dr. Moore, who was not involved in the research.","","The F.D.A. has not yet scheduled an official vote on whether to recommend mRNA boosters for Johnson & Johnson recipients.","","“We have not reviewed those data in detail,” Dr. Peter Marks, the F.D.A.’s top vaccine regulator, said on Friday.","","The agency may authorize an mRNA booster for Johnson & Johnson recipients in the future, he said, although he did not provide any more information about the timing of such a decision.","","At Friday’s meeting, Dr. Ofer Levy, director of the Precision Vaccines Program at Boston Children’s Hospital and a member of the advisory committee, encouraged regulators to move swiftly, noting that many Johnson & Johnson recipients had already sought out unauthorized mRNA boosters on their own.","","“In the real world, all these kinds of combinations or extra boosters are already happening, so I think it’s a matter of some urgency for F.D.A. to help sort out what is admittedly a complicated and challenging scenario,” he said.","","What happens next?","The F.D.A. will review the panel’s recommendation and issue a final decision, which could come within a few days.","","Next week, a vaccine advisory panel to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will make its own recommendation on Johnson & Johnson boosters. Its members will decide whether to recommend the shots at all, as well as who should be eligible.","","The C.D.C.’s director, Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, will then issue the agency’s formal guidelines on boosters. These guidelines are highly influential for doctors, pharmacies and health care providers.","","What should I do in the meantime?","For now, sit tight. No booster has yet been authorized for Johnson & Johnson recipients — the process is still underway.","","“I imagine by this time next week, the federal government’s health experts will have made a recommendation to the American people about what they should do,” Dr. Moore said.","","But it is possible that regulators will authorize a second Johnson & Johnson shot before they authorize mRNA boosters for J.&J. recipients. If that happens, people who got the Johnson & Johnson shot will be “on the horns of a dilemma,” said Dr. William Schaffner, medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases and a vaccine expert at Vanderbilt University.","","People should consult with their doctors about whether it makes sense to get a Johnson & Johnson booster as soon as it is authorized or wait for a possible mRNA booster, Dr. Schaffner said.","","“A lot depends on where you are and who you are,” he said. People who are at high risk for serious disease and live in places where the virus is surging may not want to wait, he said.","","ADVERTISEMENT","","Continue reading the main story","Site Information Navigation","© 2021 The New York Times Company","NYTCoContact UsAccessibilityWork with usAdvertiseT Brand StudioYour Ad ChoicesPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapHelpSubscriptions",""],"https://news.trust.org/item/20210928125401-hra40/":["ABOUT THOMSON REUTERS FOUNDATION ","Sign up for our Newsletter|Member Login","","Pfizer submits data for COVID-19 vaccine use in younger kids","by Reuters","Tuesday, 28 September 2021 20:37 GMT","(Adds details from Wall Street Journal report)","","Sept 28 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE on Tuesday submitted initial trial data for their COVID-19 vaccine in 5-11 year olds and said they would make a formal request to U.S. regulators for emergency use in the coming weeks.","","The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said earlier this month it would look to complete its data review for this age group as quickly as possible, likely in a matter of weeks rather than months. That could mean an authorization of the shot for children by the end of October, sources have told Reuters.","","The companies, however, have yet to start the official process for authorization, which could slow the decision. According to the Wall Street Journal, the FDA may not make its decision until sometime between Halloween and Thanksgiving, citing a person familiar with the matter.","","A Pfizer spokesperson said the company expects to start and complete its application very soon.","","A decision on the vaccine's use in younger children is eagerly awaited by millions of Americans as coronavirus infections have soared in children to the highest point in early September, according to data from the American Academy of Pediatrics.","","The vaccine, which is already authorized for 12 to 15-year- olds and fully approved for ages 16 and up, induced a strong immune response in the target age group in a 2,268-participant clinical trial, the companies said on Sept. 20.","","The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was authorized for the 12-15 age group roughly a month after the companies filed for authorization. If the same timeline is followed for this application, younger children could start receiving their shots as soon as late October.","","A rapid authorization could help mitigate a potential surge of cases this fall, with schools already open nationwide.","","While kids are less susceptible to severe COVID-19, they can spread the virus to others, including vulnerable populations that are more at risk of severe illness.","","The companies said they plan to submit the data to the European Medicines Agency and other regulatory authorities. They also plan to submit data from the full late-stage trial for scientific peer-reviewed publication.","","The FDA was not immediately available to comment.","","Data from the companies' trial showed the two-shot vaccine generated an immune response in children that matched what was previously observed in 16-to-25 year olds. The safety profile was also comparable to the older age group, Pfizer said.","","The drugmakers are also testing the vaccine in children aged 2-to-5 and those aged 6 months-to-2 years, with data expected in the fourth quarter.","","Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine is not yet authorized for use in adolescents in the United States, while it has gained authorization for that age group in Europe.","","Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines have been linked by regulators to rare cases of heart inflammation in adolescents and young adults, particularly young men. Pfizer said no instances of heart inflammation were seen in the trial participants.","","(Reporting by Manas Mishra and Ankur Banerjee in Bengaluru; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty and Dan Grebler)","","Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",""," THEMES","VULNERABLE PEOPLEFOOD GENERALHEALTH AND DISEASE","SHARETWEETSHAREEMAIL","EXPLORE MORE HUMANITARIAN CRISES NEWS","'You are making the future today', Pope tells youth climate activists","","Afghanistan's Taliban say working on reopening girls' high schools","","More Canadian businesses will embrace vaccine mandates for workers - minister","","Canadian indigenous group takes charge of child welfare services","","About Thomson Reuters Foundation News","news.trust.org","","Our global editorial team of about 55 journalists and more than 350 freelancers covers the lives of people around the world who struggle to live freely or fairly.","","FIND OUT MORE","Newsletter sign up:","","Terms and Conditions Privacy and Cookies Acceptable Use Policy Contact Us Trust Principles","Copyright © 2020 Thomson Reuters Foundation.

(NYSE: PFE, “Pfizer”) and BioNTech SE (Nasdaq: BNTX, “BioNTech”) today announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) issued a positive opinion on the administration of the companies’ COVID-19 vaccine as a booster dose at least six months after the second dose in individuals 18 years of age and older. The European Commission (EC) will review the CHMP recommendation and is expected to make a final decision on a variation to the Conditional Marketing Authorization in the near future. If the EC grants the variation regarding a booster dose, the decision will be immediately applicable to all 27 EU member states.","","The positive opinion by the CHMP is based on the clinical trial data shared by the companies, real world evidence as well as literature data. The data submitted by BioNTech and Pfizer include data from their clinical program evaluating the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of a booster dose of COMIRNATY®. A booster dose of the vaccine elicited significantly higher neutralizing antibody titers against the initial SARS-CoV-2 virus (wild type), as well as the Beta and Delta variants, when compared with the levels observed after the two-dose primary series. The reactogenicity profile within seven days after the booster dose was typically mild to moderate, and the frequency of reactions was similar to or lower than after dose two. The adverse event profile was generally consistent with other clinical safety data for COMIRNATY.","","Pfizer and BioNTech continue to supply the vaccine, including sufficient volume for boosters, under their existing supply agreement with the EC. The companies do not expect the introduction of booster doses in the United States and the EU, if authorized, to impact the existing supply agreements in place with governments and international health organizations around the world.","","COMIRNATY, which is based on BioNTech’s proprietary mRNA technology, was developed by both BioNTech and Pfizer. BioNTech is the Marketing Authorization Holder in the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Canada and the holder of emergency use authorizations or equivalents in the United States (jointly with Pfizer) and other countries. Submissions to pursue regulatory approvals in those countries where emergency use authorizations or equivalent were initially granted are ongoing.","","AUTHORIZED USE IN THE EU:","COMIRNATY® ▼ (the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine) has been granted conditional marketing authorisation by the by the European Commission to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in people from 12 years of age. The European Medicines Agency’s (EMA’s) human medicines committee (CHMP) has completed its rigorous evaluation of COMIRNATY®, concluding by consensus that sufficiently robust data on the quality, safety and efficacy of the vaccine are now available.","","IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION:","","Events of anaphylaxis have been reported. Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic reaction following the administration of the vaccine.","Very rare cases of myocarditis and pericarditis have been observed following vaccination with Comirnaty. These cases have primarily occurred within 14 days following vaccination, more often after the second vaccination, and more often in younger men. Available data suggest that the course of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination is not different from myocarditis or pericarditis in general.","Anxiety-related reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation or stress‐related reactions (e.g. dizziness, palpitations, increases in heart rate, alterations in blood pressure, tingling sensations and sweating) may occur in association with the vaccination process itself. Stress-related reactions are temporary and resolve on their own. Individuals should be advised to bring symptoms to the attention of the vaccination provider for evaluation. It is important that precautions are in place to avoid injury from fainting.","The efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine has not been assessed in immunocompromised individuals, including those receiving immunosuppressant therapy. The efficacy of COMIRNATY® may be lower in immunosuppressed individuals.","As with any vaccine, vaccination with COMIRNATY® may not protect all vaccine recipients. Individuals may not be fully protected until 7 days after their second dose of vaccine.","In clinical studies, adverse reactions in participants 16 years of age and older were injection site pain (> 80%), fatigue (> 60%), headache (> 50%), myalgia and chills (> 30%), arthralgia (> 20%), pyrexia and injection site swelling (> 10%) and were usually mild or moderate in intensity and resolved within a few days after vaccination. A slightly lower frequency of reactogenicity events was associated with greater age.","The overall safety profile of COMIRNATY® in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age was similar to that seen in participants 16 years of age and older. The most frequent adverse reactions in clinical trial participants 12 to 15 years of age were injection site pain (> 90%), fatigue and headache (> 70%), myalgia and chills (> 40%), arthralgia and pyrexia (> 20%).","There is limited experience with use of COMIRNATY® in pregnant women. Administration of COMIRNATY® in pregnancy should only be considered when the potential benefits outweigh any potential risks for the mother and fetus.","It is unknown whether COMIRNATY® is excreted in human milk.","Interactions with other medicinal products or concomitant administration of COMIRNATY® with other vaccines has not been studied.","For complete information on the safety of COMIRNATY® always make reference to the approved Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet available in all the languages of the European Union on the EMA website.","The black equilateral triangle denotes that additional monitoring is required to capture any adverse reactions. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. Individuals can help by reporting any side effects they may get. Side effects can be reported to EudraVigilance or directly to BioNTech using email medinfo@biontech.de, telephone +49 6131 9084 0, or via the website www.biontech.de","","Emergency uses of the vaccine have not been approved or licensed by FDA, but have been authorized by FDA, under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to prevent Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in individuals 12 years of age and older. The emergency uses are only authorized for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of emergency use of the medical product under Section 564(b)(1) of the FD&C Act unless the declaration is terminated or authorization revoked sooner.

Pfizer assumes no obligation to update forward-looking statements contained in this release as the result of new information or future events or developments.","","This release contains forward-looking information about Pfizer’s efforts to combat COVID-19, the collaboration between BioNTech and Pfizer to develop a COVID-19 vaccine, the BNT162 mRNA vaccine program and COMIRNATY (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA) (BNT162b2) (including a potential booster dose and a potential variation of the conditional marketing authorization of BNT162b2 in the EU to include the administration of a booster dose in individuals 18 years of age and older, qualitative assessments of available data, potential benefits, expectations for clinical trials, the anticipated timing of data readouts, regulatory submissions, regulatory approvals or authorizations and anticipated manufacturing, distribution and supply) involving substantial risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Risks and uncertainties include, among other things, the uncertainties inherent in research and development, including the ability to meet anticipated clinical endpoints, commencement and/or completion dates for clinical trials, regulatory submission dates, regulatory approval dates and/or launch dates, as well as risks associated with preclinical and clinical data (including the Phase 3 data), including the possibility of unfavorable new preclinical, clinical or safety data and further analyses of existing preclinical, clinical or safety data; whether and when our Phase 3 clinical trial will demonstrate protection from infection or disease following a booster dose, which is the subject of ongoing study; the ability to produce comparable clinical or other results, including the rate of vaccine effectiveness and safety and tolerability profile observed to date, in additional analyses of the Phase 3 trial and additional studies or in larger, more diverse populations following commercialization; the ability of BNT162b2 to prevent COVID-19 caused by emerging virus variants; the risk that more widespread use of the vaccine will lead to new information about efficacy, safety, or other developments, including the risk of additional adverse reactions, some of which may be serious; the risk that preclinical and clinical trial data are subject to differing interpretations and assessments, including during the peer review/publication process, in the scientific community generally, and by regulatory authorities; whether and when additional data from the BNT162 mRNA vaccine program will be published in scientific journal publications and, if so, when and with what modifications and interpretations; whether regulatory authorities will be satisfied with the design of and results from these and any future preclinical and clinical studies; whether and when applications for a potential booster dose will be filed in any other jurisdictions, whether and when submissions to the FDA and other regulatory authorities to request emergency use or conditional marketing authorizations for BNT162b2 in younger pediatric populations will be made and whether and when other biologics license and/or emergency use authorization applications or amendments to any such applications may be filed in particular jurisdictions for BNT162b2 or any other potential vaccines that may arise from the BNT162 program, and if obtained, whether or when such emergency use authorization or licenses will expire or terminate;

(NYSE: PFE) and BioNTech SE (Nasdaq: BNTX) announced they have submitted data to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) from the Phase 2/3 trial of their COVID-19 vaccine in children 5 to <12 years of age.","","This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210928005307/en/","","The Companies announced positive topline results from the pivotal trial on September 20, 2021. In the trial, which included 2,268 participants 5 to <12 years of age, the vaccine demonstrated a favorable safety profile and elicited robust neutralizing antibody responses using a two-dose regimen of 10 μg doses. These results – the first from a pivotal trial of any COVID-19 vaccine in this age group – were comparable to those recorded in a previous Pfizer-BioNTech study in people 16 to 25 years of age, who were immunized with 30 μg doses. The 10 μg dose was carefully selected as the preferred dose for safety, tolerability and immunogenicity in children 5 to <12 years of age.","","These data have been shared with the FDA for the Agency’s initial review. A formal submission to request Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) of the companies’ COVID-19 vaccine in children 5 to <12 years of age is expected to follow in the coming weeks. Submissions to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and other regulatory authorities are also planned.","","Topline immunogenicity and safety readouts for the other two age cohorts from the trial – children 2 to <5 years of age and children 6 months to <2 years of age – are expected as soon as the fourth quarter of this year.","","Pfizer and BioNTech plan to submit data from the full Phase 3 trial for scientific peer-reviewed publication.","","About the Phase 1/2/3 Trial in Children","","The Phase 1/2/3 trial initially enrolled up to 4,500 children ages 6 months to <12 years of age in the United States, Finland, Poland, and Spain from more than 90 clinical trial sites. It was designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine on a two-dose schedule (approximately 21 days apart) in three age groups: ages 5 to <12 years; ages 2 to <5 years; and ages 6 months to <2 years. Based on the Phase 1 dose-escalation portion of the trial, children 5 to <12 years of age received a two-dose schedule of 10 μg each while children under age 5 received a lower 3 μg dose for each injection in the Phase 2/3 study. The trial enrolled children with or without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","","The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, which is based on BioNTech’s proprietary mRNA technology, was developed by both BioNTech and Pfizer. BioNTech is the Marketing Authorization Holder in the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Canada and the holder of emergency use authorizations or equivalents in the United States (jointly with Pfizer) and other countries. Submissions to pursue regulatory approvals in those countries where emergency use authorizations or equivalent were initially granted are planned.","","COMIRNATY® U.S. Indication & Authorized Use","","HOW IS THE VACCINE GIVEN?","","The vaccine will be given to you as an injection into the muscle.","","Primary Series: The vaccine is administered as a 2-dose series, 3 weeks apart.

Experts hailed the news as potentially a huge advance in the fight against COVID-19.","","At the same time, shares of vaccine makers such as Moderna Inc (MRNA.O), Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and partner BioNTech SE were hit, with some analysts saying the promise of an oral drug that can be taken at home could change the public perception of risks associated with COVID-19.","","\"We see modest perceived headwind to vaccine stocks such as MRNA (Moderna) if the market thinks people will be less afraid of COVID-19 and less inclined to get vaccines, if there is a simple pill that can treat COVID-19,\" Jefferies analyst Michael Yee said in a client note.","","Moderna shares tumbled 13% in midday trading, while Pfizer, which is developing a COVID-19 pill of its own, fell 1.3%. U.S. shares of BioNTech dropped 11%.","","For Moderna investors, the Merck news presented an opportunity to lock in gains after an already stunning run. Shares of Moderna, which were added to the S&P 500 in mid July, remain up some 220% in 2021 despite Friday's declines. BioNTech's shares were also still up about 200% for the year, even with Friday's fall.","","The Merck news is a \"great reason for folks to be taking profits off the table” in Moderna and BioNTech shares, said Sahak Manuelian, head of equity trading at Wedbush Securities. \"These moves can get exacerbated to the downside given the momentum they have had to the upside.\"","","","","1/3","FILE PHOTO: Vials of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccines of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna are seen in the town of Ricany near Prague, Czech Republic, February 25, 2021.

Rivals such as Pfizer and Swiss drugmaker Roche Holding AG (ROG.S) with partner Atea Pharmaceuticals Inc (AVIR.O) are running late-stage trials of their pills.

Robert Michael/Pool via Reuters","","Summary","Backs 3rd shot for immuno-compromised 28 days after 2nd","Booster shot for all after 6 months may be considered","Oct 4 (Reuters) - The European Union's drugs regulator said on Monday people with weakened immune systems should get a third dose of a COVID-19 vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna, but left it to member states to decide if the wider population should have a booster.","","The long-awaited guidance comes after several EU member states pre-empted the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) opinion and launched their own booster campaigns, although they vary widely over who is eligible. read more","","The EU joins the United States, Britain and Israel where regulators have approved the use of Pfizer-BioNTech (PFE.N), (22UAy.DE) boosters, although there is no consensus among scientists about how broadly they should be rolled out. Israel is the outlier, deploying them across the whole population.","","The EMA said people with a severely weakened immune system should be given a third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna (MRNA.O) vaccines - both based on so-called mRNA technology - at least 28 days after their second one.","","Many treatments for cancer patients or for people with organ transplants suppress the immune system, making them particularly vulnerable to a coronavirus infection with reduced help offered from vaccines.","","Results from Italian studies released on Monday showed COVID-19 vaccines are less effective on people with weakened immune systems. read more","","The EMA also said a booster shot of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine could be considered for adults with normal immune systems around six months after the second dose, but added that was up to individual countries.","","Governments are under pressure to revive their ailing economies, fight the more infectious Delta variant, and avoid further lockdowns this winter.","","The EMA's ruling comes after the EU's infectious diseases centre warned last week the region's coverage of vaccines was still too low and there was a risk of a significant surge in cases, hospitalisations and deaths over the next six weeks.","","MORE DATA","","Marc Van Ranst, virologist at the University of Leuven in Belgium said decision on boosters was expected and would \"legitimise the choices that some governments already made\" in Europe.","","He added the EMA’s broad go-ahead could lead to a further fragmentation of national decisions on the use of boosters, but more data was needed for the regulator to justify a more specific verdict.","","Antonella Viola, professor of immunology at Italy's University of Padua, said the risk of heart inflammation from the mRNA vaccines, albeit rare, needed to be taken into account and the benefit of a booster for younger adults was questionable.","","The World Health Organization has criticised rich nations for hoarding COVID-19 vaccines for booster campaigns for larger population groups while poorer countries are struggling to rollout even first doses.","","Allowing EU countries to decide broader use of a booster is consistent with the EMA's earlier decisions in the pandemic - for instance it largely left it up to member states to decide whether to restrict vaccines in the face of potential side effects.","","The EMA said it was hoping to see more data to underpin recommendation updates.","","Pfizer and BioNTech presented data in their filings for their booster that showed levels of virus-fighting antibodies in the blood of vaccinated people wane over time and that a third shot was shown to cause a fresh surge in antibodies.","","Researchers say immune cells, another important factor in immunisation, might confer longer-lasting protection against severe disease but their presence in the blood is more difficult to measure and more research is needed.","","The University of Padua's Viola said the young and healthy, in particular, should be not get a repeat shot.","","\"The vaccines we have used protect everyone from severe disease with very high efficacy,\" she added.","","The EMA said on Sept. 6 it had begun evaluating data submitted by Pfizer and BioNTech for a booster dose in people with a functioning immune system, with infections among vaccinated people adding urgency to its review. read more","","It also started evaluating last week the merits of a booster dose of Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine. read more","","Reporting by Ludwig Burger in Frankfurt and Yadarisa Shabong in Bengaluru, Emilio Parodi in Milan, Francesco Guarascio in Brussels Editing by Maju Samuel and Mark Potter","Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.","","More from Reuters","Sign up for our newsletter","Subscribe for our daily curated newsletter to receive the latest exclusive Reuters coverage delivered to your inbox.","","","Sign up","","","Latest","Home","Browse","World","Business","Legal","Markets","Breakingviews","Technology","Investigations","Lifestyle","Media","Videos","Pictures","Graphics","About Reuters","About Reuters","Careers","Reuters News Agency","Brand Attribution Guidelines","Reuters Leadership","Reuters Fact Check","Reuters Diversity Report","Stay Informed","Download the App","Newsletters","Information you can trust","Reuters, the news and media division of Thomson Reuters, is the world’s largest multimedia news provider, reaching billions of people worldwide every day.
